But the question is whether ‘Everything that begins to exist has a cause’ (1st premise of the KCA) is more plausible than its negation. It has to be taken on blind faith that there could be uncaused finite entities, such as the uncaused universe. By no means would this assertion be more plausible than ‘God created the Heavens and the Earth’.",28,5,-1

43,"Per se causal chains are composed of a principal cause, and a series of subsequent instrumental causes. An instrumental cause is one that derives whatever causal power it has from something else. In Aquinas’ famous example, the stick that the hand uses to push the stone has no power to push the stone on its own, but derives its stone-moving power from the hand, which uses it as an “instrument.” A principal cause is one that does have its causal power inherently.",42,5,1

It is incorrect to say that the primordial universe was of finite size as this concept of size in not well-defined as such. It is unclear whether the universe is of finite size, however observational data best fit with the conclusion that the universe is infinite and flat.",45,5,-1
47,"Even if it is true that causal chains cannot regress infinitely, assuming that the first cause is God is begging the question.",41,5,1
48,"The cause is merely the absence of anything decomposing it. Absent such a decomposing cause, things will persist as they are.",47,5,1

51,"A causal chain can regress to infinity just as it can continue onward to infinity, provided that no change in the given direction of time starts from or results in something which is incapable of accumulating change, and provided the environment involved doesn't reach a stage in the given direction of time which permanently prohibits the accumulation of change in that temporal direction.",35,5,-1
52,"""per accidens"" (or linear) causal chains can indeed regress to infinity.  However, there is another kind of causal chain. This kind of causal chain cannot, by its very nature, regress to infinity. ""Per se"" (or hierarchical) causal chains are ones where each link has its causal power instrumentally, not inherently. Per se causal chains occur simultaneously, all at once.  To bring ""time"" into the discussion is to discuss per accidens causal chains, which are not a part of the proof.",51,5,-1
53,"An absolutely simple being is of necessity pure actuality (as opposed to potentiality) and thus is necessarily all-powerful, all-knowing, immaterial, etc.",34,5,1
54,"If there is an Unmoved Mover at the root of all change in the universe, then that means every potentiality which is actualized, or even could be actualized is fundamentally derivative of that Mover. To be able to actualize every possible potentiality is just what it means to be ""omnipotent.""",53,5,1
55,"This kind of ""omnipotence"" need only be in place at the time of the universe's creation, and does not need to be an active force, making the Unmoved Mover a deistic God, rather than theistic.",54,5,-1
56,"The Unmoved Mover is not proved by reference to a chronological beginning of the world, but rather a hierarchical ""beginning"" of the world, which is here and now, at every moment of time in action.",55,5,-1
57,"In fact, Aquinas considered that reason alone could not prove that the world had a beginning. Aristotle considered that the universe had always existed, yet he made a similar first-way argument [13] for the existence of God.",56,5,1
58,"The Unmoved Mover is outside of time (eternal), therefore it is present before the begining of time and has no end.",55,5,-1
59,"The ability to actualize is distinct from actualization. The ability to actualize requires decision making power, whereas intelligence is not required for actualization. The ultimate cause of the universe only requires actualization.",54,5,-1
60,"If there is not an Unmoved Mover at the root of all change in the universe, then that means no potentiality which is actualized, or even could be actualized is fundamentally derivative of such an Unmoved Mover. No such Unmoved Mover has been demonstrated to exist, let alone to exist and be omnipotent. If an Unmoved Mover does not exist, then it can have no direct effect on the real world and is therefore not omnipotent in reality.",54,5,-1
61,"If one accepts that the universe came into existence, then to argue it must have been caused assumes that the current laws of the universe were the same at the time of creation. We know that the physical laws break down at a certain point, so it is conceivable that the cause/effect principle did not apply at the beginning.",34,5,-1
62,"The principle of causation is not a physical law.",61,5,-1
63,"The principle of causation only states that causes are at least partially responsible for effects, and effects are at least partially dependent on causes. It isn't necessary that time be involved whatsoever.",62,5,1
64,"Imagine a ball colliding with a sheet of fabric. When the ball impacts with the fabric it creates a dent in it - but the dent appears at the exact same time as the impact. However, despite no time difference between the cause and effect, we still know which is which.",63,5,1
65,"The argument from change (properly understood) makes no claim about the historical creation of the universe. This would be a ""per accidens"" causal chain, which can, in theory, extend backwards forever. The argument depends on a ""per se"" causal chain which is present at every distinct moment of existence. Thus the ""physical laws"" are irrelevant to the validity of the argument.",61,5,-1
66,"The argument is inductive, as it assumes all changes have causes from our experience, which is bound by the natural laws. That being said, these laws many not apply on the quantum level or at the beginning of the universe.",65,5,-1
67,"Time is a measure of change - without time, there is no change. As such, it does not make sense to discuss a cause that brought the universe and time into existence, since the universe going from potential to actual entails change.",34,5,-1
68,"Change does not require time to pass. Change in the broad sense meant here means only ""actualization of potential."" If there were no time, but only one moment of existence for our world, that moment would still require the actualization of the potential for existence in all the myriad things of this world. Thus, each and every distinct moment of time, and not any collection of moments, represents ""change"" in the relevant sense.",67,5,-1
69,"Change is a ""an act or process through which something becomes different."" Acts and processes ential time; indeed, Aristotle recognized that time is a measure of change. To speak about a moment of ""existence"" without time is nonsensical, as nothing has been demonstrated to exist outside of time.",68,5,-1
70,"While temporal change is a valid kind of change, it is not the (only) kind of change meant by the proof from change. As stated in the proof, all that is meant by ""change"" is ""actualization of potential."" Temporal change is a subset of the kind of change meant here.",69,5,-1
71,"A potential cannot become actual without the passing of time. This follows because a potential isn't actual, and while it can *become* actual this must temporally follow the state where it hasn't yet been actualized. It is impossible for there to be no temporal distinction between a potential and an actuality, because such a thing would imply the potential and the actuality are the same thing (which they by definition aren't). Therefore there must be passing of time for change to happen.",70,5,-1

74,"The argument doesn't negate the possibility of multiple unmoved movers.",34,5,-1
75,"This series of ""unmoved movers"" would, as a whole comprise the single set we would understand as a classical theistic god.",74,5,-1
76,"In order for there to be multiple unmoved movers (composed of Pure Act), there must be some differentiating feature that one mover has and the others lack. There can only be a differentiating feature if there is some unactualized potential one mover has.  But this defeats the definition of the unmoved mover as pure act, with no potentiality whatsoever.  Thus, if there is an unmoved mover, by definition, there must only be one. (Oneness being a classical attribute of God)",74,5,-1
77,"There is no need for there to be a differentiating feature beyond it not being the same one.",76,5,-1

85,"The very first of the famous Twenty Four Thomistic Theses [14] is: “Potency and Act divide being in such a way that whatever is, is either pure act, or of necessity it is composed of potency and act as primary and intrinsic principles.”",84,5,1
86,"The postulation of Act and Potency as real features of the universe is a claim which is impossible to verify scientifically.",84,5,-1

94,"It is false that philosophy has given up metaphysical concepts [15]. They are still a fundamental part of modern philosophical discussion.",92,5,-1
95,"This can be said to be true, but it can be taken as a defense of Theism.

99,"Things that are pure actuality, such as an unmoved mover, are incapable of change [17]. Therefore, things that are pure actuality do not have the capacity to create. If a god is pure actuality, it cannot have created the universe.",97,5,1
100,"Pure actuality is indeed incapable of change. But, pure actuality can create. This is because the act of creation doesn't necessarily entail that the creator must itself change.  Creation/change can only be done by something already in existence; It does not follow that this thing must change in order to create.  If creation required self-change, then the per se causal chains we see in the world would have no first member, which is incoherent, given the nature of per se causal chains.",99,5,-1

Because before, I could be defined as a human living in the universe with state A, but after the change, I would have to be defined as a human living in the universe with state B. This seems absurd.

109,"There are two kinds of properties: Cambridge [18] properties [19] and Real properties.  The doctrine of divine immutability properly understood says that God cannot change in any real properties, but it allows that he may change with respect to his Cambridge properties.
