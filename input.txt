1. Thesis:
God [1] exists.

  1.1. Con:
  The available scientific evidence supports the non-existence of God.

    1.1.1. Con:
    The origins of the universe [2] are best explained by the existence of God.

      1.1.1.1. Con:
      God, with the qualities of Classical Theism [3], is not necessarily the root cause of the universe.

        1.1.1.1.1. Con:
        The law of entropy indicates that the cause of the universe must be infinite and completely lacking entropy.  If God's entropy is 0 and he is infinite than he must necessarily be good at least to the extent that entropy is defined as lack of order or chaos.

          1.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
          The law of entropy does not require the universe be infinite, or to lack entropy at the beginning.

          1.1.1.1.1.2. Con:
          Saying something could be the answer does not make it more likely then other scenarios.

          1.1.1.1.1.3. Con:
          There's no reason to believe the second law of thermodynamics matters in respect to metaphysical claims. It doesn't even necessarily affect all physical claims because we still haven't figured out how the laws of pshysics worked during the beginning of the universe.

        1.1.1.1.2. Con:
        Being the ultimate cause of everything that has a cause would be omnipotence in the purest form.

          1.1.1.1.2.1. Con:
          Omnipotence is generally defined as "having unlimited power and potential; being able to bring about (effortlessly) any possible state of affairs." This seems incompatible with being an "unmoved mover" or "pure actuality"

            1.1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro:
            Pure actuality, by definition, would have no potentials, and hence no powers. It couldn't do/be anything other than what it in fact did/was.

          1.1.1.1.2.2. Con:
          Being able to cause the cosmos to exist is not the same as being able to do anything. Whatever can cause the cosmos to exist may not be able to do other things, such as communicate with humans.

        1.1.1.1.3. Pro:
        Even if there were some force that pushed the universe to existence, there is no evidence it would resemble the humanity's understanding of the God rather than simply another law of physics. For example, there is no evidence that the force that created the universe has any knowledge of Earth or humans, or that it is even capable of such a thing.

      1.1.1.2. Pro:
      Every building has a builder. Every painting has a painter. So, that must mean Creation has a Creator.

        1.1.1.2.1. Con:
        We have evidence the builder of a building exists or existed. as with the painter of a painting. We can't demonstrate that creation has a creator.

        1.1.1.2.2. Con:
        Builders and painters have materials and tools to work with, extracted from the natural environment. A potential creator of existence by definition could not thus making this a poor comparison or an admission of nature predating such a creator and his work.

        1.1.1.2.3. Con:
        By that logic, that Creator also has a creator, making this agent or element non-explanatory.

        1.1.1.2.4. Con:
        However, a mountain has neither a single nor a plurality of long-working tectonic plate- or rubble-moving beings. Instead, those are natural forces/processes.

      1.1.1.3. Con:
      The universe and everything in it is part of an infinite cycle of probabilistic events.

        1.1.1.3.1. Con:
        Appealing to infinity is less parsimonious than appealing to a simple, unembodied mind (God). Therefore, it is an inferior explanation.

          1.1.1.3.1.1. Con:
          The language of disembodied minds is hugely problematic. It maybe an article of faith but it poses more questions than it lays to rest.

            1.1.1.3.1.1.1. Con:
            Regardless of the questions that remain, 'disembodied minds' have less problems conceptually than for example 'infinite regresses' and 'uncaused contingent facts' do. Therefore, it is the superior explanation.

            1.1.1.3.1.1.2. Con:
            Unless examples are given of the insurmountable problems to the idea of a mind without a body, this objection amounts to nothing more than an argument from personal incredulity [4]

        1.1.1.3.2. Pro:
        This God is improbable when one considers the possibility of endless rising and fallings of forms and events from a quantum field.

      1.1.1.4. Pro:
      The Kalam cosmological argument [5] demonstrates the universe requires a cause and the best candidate for this cause is God.

        1.1.1.4.1. Con:
        The only things known about the cause of the universe (if indeed there is one) are (1) that it did (and hence could) cause the universe, and (2) that it isn't the universe itself or part of it. Nothing else can be inferred, and hence it is unjustified to infer it was anything like the God of classical theism.

        1.1.1.4.2. Con:
        The Kalam cosmological argument commits several logical fallacies.

          1.1.1.4.2.1. Pro:
          The Kalam cosmological argument commits the fallacy of composition [6].

            1.1.1.4.2.1.1. Con:
            The fallacy would be to infer ‘The universe has a cause’ from the observation that everything in the universe seems to be caused by something else. But the question is whether ‘Everything that begins to exist has a cause’ (1st premise of the KCA) is more plausible than its negation. It has to be taken on blind faith that there could be uncaused finite entities, such as the uncaused universe. By no means would this assertion be more plausible than ‘God created the Heavens and the Earth’.

          1.1.1.4.2.2. Pro:
          All popular versions of the cosmological argument arbitrarily decide that a god does not require a creator. To arbitrarily require this is special pleading [7].

            1.1.1.4.2.2.1. Con:
            Aquinas' First Way [8] results in a God who could not, in principle, have been created.

              1.1.1.4.2.2.1.1. Con:
              The neo-platonic model claims that God, a being that is all-powerful, all-knowing, and exists outside of time and space, is absolutely simple. This is contradictory.

              1.1.1.4.2.2.1.2. Con:
              Aquinas's conclusion only uses the word god as an end point. There is no justification for its use in his argument.

              1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3. Pro:
              The distinction between Act and Potency [9], combined with the visible fact of change [10] in our world, entails the existence of an "Unmoved Mover [11]," (aka. uncaused causer, un-actualized actualizer) which is God.

                1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.1. Pro:
                Per se causal chains [12] cannot regress to infinity, as opposed to per accidens causal chains.

                  1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.1.1. Con:
                  Objects do not need to obtain their causal power from the action of another object as though causal power were some kind of object itself which passes on from one entity to another.

                    1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.1.1.1. Pro:
                    Causal language describes the way in which objects in a temporal distribution relate to each other.

                      1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.1.1.1.1. Pro:
                      A temporal distribution can vary in either temporal direction infinitely and be an infinite causal chain so long as causal relations continue to hold in either direction.

                    1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.1.1.2. Con:
                    While it is true that, in a per accidens causal chain, beings do not need to obtain causal power from another being, it is not true in a per se causal chain. In that case, objects (and other beings) do need to obtain their causal power externally.

                  1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.1.2. Pro:
                  Per se causal chains are comprised of agents who's causal power is "borrowed" from another source. An infinite chain of such agents would provide no real source of causal power. "Turtles, all the way down." as it were.

                  1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.1.3. Con:
                  Infinite causal chains are possible in an infinite universe.

                    1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.1.3.1. Con:
                    Only "per accidens" chains may regress to infinity. (These are also occasionally referred to as linear chains.)
                    
                    "Per se" chains may not regress to infinity, regardless of the infinitude (or lack thereof) of the universe. (These are also occasionally referred to as hierarchical chains.)

                      1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.1.3.1.1. Pro:
                      Per se causal chains are composed of a principal cause, and a series of subsequent instrumental causes. An instrumental cause is one that derives whatever causal power it has from something else. In Aquinas’ famous example, the stick that the hand uses to push the stone has no power to push the stone on its own, but derives its stone-moving power from the hand, which uses it as an “instrument.” A principal cause is one that does have its causal power inherently.

                    1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.1.3.2. Con:
                    Our universe is not infinite.

                      1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.1.3.2.1. Pro:
                      Unless a method by which a finite thing can become infinity big in a finite time is provided, the big bang is sufficient to disprove an infinite universe.

                        1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.1.3.2.1.1. Con:
                        In the spirit of Einstein's theory of general relativity; the Big Bang was not a point in space but a moment in time. The Big Bang happened at all points in space at the same time. It is incorrect to say that the primordial universe was of finite size as this concept of size in not well-defined as such. It is unclear whether the universe is of finite size, however observational data best fit with the conclusion that the universe is infinite and flat.

                    1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.1.3.3. Pro:
                    Even if it is true that causal chains cannot regress infinitely, assuming that the first cause is God is begging the question.

                      1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.1.3.3.1. Pro:
                      The cause is merely the absence of anything decomposing it. Absent such a decomposing cause, things will persist as they are.

                      1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.1.3.3.2. Pro:
                      Max Tegmark's 'Mathematical Universe' argues that the foundational 'component' of composite things is mathematics, not God.

                        1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.1.3.3.2.1. Con:
                        The proof from composition states that composite things are caused by, not composed of, God.

                  1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.1.4. Con:
                  A causal chain can regress to infinity just as it can continue onward to infinity, provided that no change in the given direction of time starts from or results in something which is incapable of accumulating change, and provided the environment involved doesn't reach a stage in the given direction of time which permanently prohibits the accumulation of change in that temporal direction.

                    1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.1.4.1. Con:
                    "per accidens" (or linear) causal chains can indeed regress to infinity.
                    
                    However, there is another kind of causal chain. This kind of causal chain cannot, by its very nature, regress to infinity. "Per se" (or hierarchical) causal chains are ones where each link has its causal power instrumentally, not inherently. Per se causal chains occur simultaneously, all at once.
                    
                    To bring "time" into the discussion is to discuss per accidens causal chains, which are not a part of the proof.

                1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.2. Pro:
                An absolutely simple being is of necessity pure actuality (as opposed to potentiality) and thus is necessarily all-powerful, all-knowing, immaterial, etc.

                  1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.2.1. Pro:
                  If there is an Unmoved Mover at the root of all change in the universe, then that means every potentiality which is actualized, or even could be actualized is fundamentally derivative of that Mover. To be able to actualize every possible potentiality is just what it means to be "omnipotent."

                    1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.2.1.1. Con:
                    This kind of "omnipotence" need only be in place at the time of the universe's creation, and does not need to be an active force, making the Unmoved Mover a deistic God, rather than theistic.

                      1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.2.1.1.1. Con:
                      The Unmoved Mover is not proved by reference to a chronological beginning of the world, but rather a hierarchical "beginning" of the world, which is here and now, at every moment of time in action.

                        1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.2.1.1.1.1. Pro:
                        In fact, Aquinas considered that reason alone could not prove that the world had a beginning. Aristotle considered that the universe had always existed, yet he made a similar first-way argument [13] for the existence of God.

                      1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.2.1.1.2. Con:
                      The Unmoved Mover is outside of time (eternal), therefore it is present before the begining of time and has no end.

                    1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.2.1.2. Con:
                    The ability to actualize is distinct from actualization. The ability to actualize requires decision making power, whereas intelligence is not required for actualization. The ultimate cause of the universe only requires actualization.

                    1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.2.1.3. Con:
                    If there is not an Unmoved Mover at the root of all change in the universe, then that means no potentiality which is actualized, or even could be actualized is fundamentally derivative of such an Unmoved Mover. No such Unmoved Mover has been demonstrated to exist, let alone to exist and be omnipotent. If an Unmoved Mover does not exist, then it can have no direct effect on the real world and is therefore not omnipotent in reality.

                1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.3. Con:
                If one accepts that the universe came into existence, then to argue it must have been caused assumes that the current laws of the universe were the same at the time of creation. We know that the physical laws break down at a certain point, so it is conceivable that the cause/effect principle did not apply at the beginning.

                  1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.3.1. Con:
                  The principle of causation is not a physical law.

                    1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.3.1.1. Pro:
                    The principle of causation only states that causes are at least partially responsible for effects, and effects are at least partially dependent on causes. It isn't necessary that time be involved whatsoever.

                      1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.3.1.1.1. Pro:
                      Imagine a ball colliding with a sheet of fabric. When the ball impacts with the fabric it creates a dent in it - but the dent appears at the exact same time as the impact. However, despite no time difference between the cause and effect, we still know which is which.

                  1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.3.2. Con:
                  The argument from change (properly understood) makes no claim about the historical creation of the universe. This would be a "per accidens" causal chain, which can, in theory, extend backwards forever. The argument depends on a "per se" causal chain which is present at every distinct moment of existence. Thus the "physical laws" are irrelevant to the validity of the argument.

                    1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.3.2.1. Con:
                    The argument is inductive, as it assumes all changes have causes from our experience, which is bound by the natural laws. That being said, these laws many not apply on the quantum level or at the beginning of the universe.

                1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.4. Con:
                Time is a measure of change - without time, there is no change. As such, it does not make sense to discuss a cause that brought the universe and time into existence, since the universe going from potential to actual entails change.

                  1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.4.1. Con:
                  Change does not require time to pass. Change in the broad sense meant here means only "actualization of potential." If there were no time, but only one moment of existence for our world, that moment would still require the actualization of the potential for existence in all the myriad things of this world. Thus, each and every distinct moment of time, and not any collection of moments, represents "change" in the relevant sense.

                    1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.4.1.1. Con:
                    Change is a "an act or process through which something becomes different." Acts and processes ential time; indeed, Aristotle recognized that time is a measure of change. To speak about a moment of "existence" without time is nonsensical, as nothing has been demonstrated to exist outside of time.

                      1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.4.1.1.1. Con:
                      While temporal change is a valid kind of change, it is not the (only) kind of change meant by the proof from change. As stated in the proof, all that is meant by "change" is "actualization of potential." Temporal change is a subset of the kind of change meant here.

                        1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.4.1.1.1.1. Con:
                        A potential cannot become actual without the passing of time. This follows because a potential isn't actual, and while it can *become* actual this must temporally follow the state where it hasn't yet been actualized. It is impossible for there to be no temporal distinction between a potential and an actuality, because such a thing would imply the potential and the actuality are the same thing (which they by definition aren't). Therefore there must be passing of time for change to happen.

                    1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.4.1.2. Con:
                    An instance in time is analagous to a picture. Change occurs over subsequent instances, much like a series of photos can demonstrate change in the setting.

                      1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.4.1.2.1. Con:
                      -> See 1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.4.1.1.1.

                1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.5. Con:
                The argument doesn't negate the possibility of multiple unmoved movers.

                  1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.5.1. Con:
                  This series of "unmoved movers" would, as a whole comprise the single set we would understand as a classical theistic god.

                  1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.5.2. Con:
                  In order for there to be multiple unmoved movers (composed of Pure Act), there must be some differentiating feature that one mover has and the others lack.
                  There can only be a differentiating feature if there is some unactualized potential one mover has.
                  
                  But this defeats the definition of the unmoved mover as pure act, with no potentiality whatsoever.
                  
                  Thus, if there is an unmoved mover, by definition, there must only be one. (Oneness being a classical attribute of God)

                    1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.5.2.1. Con:
                    There is no need for there to be a differentiating feature beyond it not being the same one.

                      1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.5.2.1.1. Con:
                      Two things can only be distinct if they have some feature which differentiates them. Even two theoretically identical apples are different in that they are not in the same location, and are not composed of the exact same atoms. There must be at least one differentiating feature.

                        1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.5.2.1.1.1. Con:
                        If God is everywhere then location does not matter. If God is immaterial then atoms don't factor into the differentiation.

                    1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.5.2.2. Con:
                    There is no reason to assume that any of the other non-composite entities need to be pure act (Unmoved movers).

                      1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.5.2.2.1. Con:
                      By definition, an Unmoved Mover, First Cause or Necessary Being must be pure act.

                1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.6. Con:
                Reality is not divided by Act and Potency.

                  1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.6.1. Pro:
                  The fact that a semantic distinction can be made between actuality and potentiality does not imply anything but our own creativity.

                    1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.6.1.1. Con:
                    The distinction between act and potency is not merely semantic, but is a real feature of the world.

                      The very first of the famous Twenty Four Thomistic Theses [14] is: “Potency and Act divide being in such a way that whatever is, is either pure act, or of necessity it is composed of potency and act as primary and intrinsic principles.”

                      The postulation of Act and Potency as real features of the universe is a claim which is impossible to verify scientifically.

                        The scientific method itself presupposes the existence of Act and Potency as real features of the world. Since these notions are implicit in the business of science, it is intrinsically impossible to scientifically verify their existence.

                              This is false. Science assumes a metaphysics which allows it to operate. Even the very notion of causation is a metaphysical posit.

                            This can be said to be true, but it can be taken as a defense of Theism. A metaphysical science would for example make use of deductive reasoning or a descending process of acquiring knowledge, meaning taking claims from a religion that make logical sense and then following the procedure prescribed by the religion and discovering if the promised results come.

                          Pure actuality is indeed incapable of change. But, pure actuality can create. This is because the act of creation doesn't necessarily entail that the creator must itself change.
                          
                          Creation/change can only be done by something already in existence; It does not follow that this thing must change in order to create.
                          
                          If creation required self-change, then the per se causal chains we see in the world would have no first member, which is incoherent, given the nature of per se causal chains.

                                This implies that whenever anything about the universe changes, my essence fundamentally changes as well. Because before, I could be defined as a human living in the universe with state A, but after the change, I would have to be defined as a human living in the universe with state B. This seems absurd. I have not (necessarily) changed because a star was born 10,000 light-years away.

                              The doctrine of divine immutability properly understood says that God cannot change in any real properties, but it allows that he may change with respect to his Cambridge properties.
                              
                              God's having created the world is a mere Cambridge property, which shows that creation does not constitute change in the pertinent sense.

                There does not necessarily need to be an unmoved mover to explain efficient motion in the world. The world could be explained by circular causes.  For example, A cause B, B caused C, C caused D, and D caused A.  Reality could be structured that acts of potency change into acts of actuality in a circular fashion, hence an unmoved mover would not be necessary to explain original physical motion.

                    It is not necessary for a single line of evidence to completely describe all features of God.

                    According to classical theism, God is the "absolutely metaphysically ultimate being" [24]. If a being is a First Cause, this this the same thing as being metaphysically ultimate, therefore the First Cause is God.

                This involves "change" and "motion" are used as a mere synonym for "coming into existence"/actualization. Since some things do not exist, this entails the Unmoved mover is not perfect, not omnipotent, or both. Therefore, the Unmoved mover is not God.

                The contingency argument [26] (also known as the Leibnizian or modal cosmological argument) states that anything which exists must have sufficient reason to exist. Since the universe exists it must have a sufficient reason, and that reason would be God.

                    The difference between "enormously powerful" and "omnipotent" is, as the difference between any finite number and infinity, infinite, so it is not reasonable to equate the two; if God is defined as omnipotent, this being is not necessarily God.

                    Any argument that refers to the "cause" of the universe is circular. A cause by its very nature precedes whatever it has caused. The universe, by definition, is all of spacetime. Since all of time is a part of the universe, it is logically impossible for anything to precede it.

                        Our best scientific evidence indicates that time came into existence. The cause for this event, commonly known as the "Big Bang" must necessarily have existed prior to creation, but obviously could not have existed chronologically prior (at a point in time prior) to time.

                                implies the existence of a past boundary at which boundary conditions must be imposed.

For null geodesics each cycle is identical to the others, except for the overall normalization of the affine parameter. Thus, as long as Hav > 0 for a null geodesic when averaged over one cycle, then Hav > 0 for any number of cycles, and this theorem [32] would imply that the geodesic is incomplete.

It also shows that some infinities are faster moving/growing than others (ie. someone who runs forever will always be ahead of someone who walks forever), which is compatible with our experience and with the definition of infinity.

                                The Grand Hotel [47] "paradox" is provably true, therefore not illogical (and therefore only paradoxical in the sense of being counter-intuitive).

                                1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.15.2.1.1.1.1.2.4.4. Con:
                                The Ross–Littlewood [48] paradox has various solutions depending on the exact variant, but it has perfectly consistent solutions (one for each variant or the problem) when we turn to physics. It is therefore not a problem with infinities.

                                  1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.15.2.1.1.1.1.2.4.4.1. Pro:
                                  After adding infinite objects  we will have infinite objects. After adding 2 objects and subtracting one over and over for an infinite time, we have infinite objects. After adding n objects, if we add and subtract an equal number of objects we end up with n objects. Thus all conclusions are self consistent and the paradox resides in equivocating different physical actions under the same abstract concept, which leads to the erring assertion that their outcomes should be the same.

                                1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.15.2.1.1.1.1.2.4.5. Con:
                                Thompson's Lamp [49] has a solution: the lamp is on or off randomly (with a probability of 50%) after being on and off at the same time (via being turned on and off infinitely fast - ie. simultaneously). Thus this paradox is one of either lack of information or erasure of information, and can have a logical solution while assuming the existence of infinities.

                                A thought experiment is not a stand-alone argument. An informative articulation of the source of the absurdity must occur (e.g. formulate into a deductive argument) instead of simply relying on vague gut reactions to a story

                                  Paradoxical ideas about actual infinities stem from their counter-intuitive nature and not from any actual/physical impossibility.

                                  These thought experiments are often paired with such articulations of the source. For example, one thing illustrated by the Hilbert's Hotel paradox is the following deductive argument: (1) If an actual infinity is possible, then set A being a proper subset of set B does not imply A is smaller than B; (2) A being a proper subset of B does imply A is smaller than B; (3) Therefore an actual infinity is not possible

                                1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.15.2.1.1.1.1.2.4.7. Con:
                                The examples, if they cannot be resolved, only exclude certain kinds of actual infinities and cannot be generalized to the type of infinity that an eternal past is or the types of infinity entailed by an eternal past, if it entails any other infinities at all.

                              An actual infinity is metaphysically absurd because its mathematical validity requires accepting the non-obvious axiom of infinity [50] and rejecting the mundane notion of proper subsets [51] having a smaller cardinality [52]

                                  The concept of natural numbers as a collection (e.g. set, category, etc..) does require the axiom of infinity but such a collection is only of interest to pure mathematics. It finds no application in science or applied mathematics, which only needs a finite but arbitrarily large set of natural numbers plus notions like limits for calculus, which do not require the axiom of infinity.

                                  Atoms are "split" into electrons and nucleons, themselves being composed of quarks. That is a deeper level of splitting, but does not indicate the possibility of an infinite regress.

                                  This is a conflation. Philosophical atoms [54] and the atoms of modern physics are not the same, the former are by definition indivisible, and the fact that we can split the latter cannot refute that.

                    The claim that the principle of sufficient reason or 1+1=2 are brute facts in fact seems to be based on nothing at all except the that these are self-evident propositions.

                  1.1.1.4.2.2.3.3.1.2. Con:
                  Neither 1+1=2 nor the principle of sufficient reason itself are brute facts, as they may be explained by an appeal to a rational, necessary, and ultimate reality rather than as arbitrary and irrationally inexplicable contingencies.

                    1.1.1.4.2.2.3.3.1.2.1. Con:
                    The universe itself might be this rational, necessary, and ultimate reality.

                      1.1.1.4.2.2.3.3.1.2.1.1. Con:
                      -> See 1.1.1.4.2.2.3.3.1.1.1.2.

                      1.1.1.4.2.2.3.3.1.2.1.2. Con:
                      To argue this merely justifies the principle of sufficient reason, which in turn supports the Leibnitzian Cosmological Argument [68] that this thread was attempting to refute.

                  1.1.1.4.2.2.3.3.1.3. Con:
                  It is not arbitrary to claim that the principle of sufficient reason applies only to concrete objects (rather than abstract principles, like mathematical or metaphysical truisms). The examples of brute facts, however, are not concrete objects.

                1.1.1.4.2.2.3.3.2. Con:
                It is a leap to say that if the principle of sufficient reason is true about entities within our universe, then the principle of sufficient reason applies to the universe as a whole; the universe as a whole may be governed by different principles than the entities it contains.

                  1.1.1.4.2.2.3.3.2.1. Con:
                  The principle of sufficient reason is a self-evident extension of rationality, the denial of which entails that the universe as a whole is ultimately irrational, inexplicable, arbitrary, and incoherent.

                1.1.1.4.2.2.3.3.3. Con:
                With no doubt and exception for the (alleged) fact that God exists; this is exactly in keeping with the parent claim and fails to present an opposing argument.

                1.1.1.4.2.2.3.3.4. Pro:
                The principle of sufficient reason is the basis of reasoned thought (and, therefore, all mathematics and science). Abandoning it on this subject would be the act of special pleading.

            1.1.1.4.2.2.4. Con:
            If God created time (the existence of a beginning and an end), then it stands to reason that God lives outside of these bounds and has no beginning nor end. Therefore it is not Special Pleading and is merely a logical characteristic of the creator of time.

            1.1.1.4.2.2.5. Con:
            The properties of God defined in the OP indicate God is "totally independent of space-time" and therefore would never begin to exist or require a creator because a beginning is time-dependent. It is not special pleading to adhere to the definition of terms specified.

            1.1.1.4.2.2.6. Con:
            The Leibnizian Cosmological Argument [69] does not arbitrarily decide that God does not require a creator; it deduces it.

          1.1.1.4.2.3. Pro:
          The Kalam argument is question begging [70] as it must assume God exists to define the notion 'begins to exist'. This is because 'begins to exist' is defined such that only God falls into the category of things that never begin to exist.

            1.1.1.4.2.3.1. Pro:
            It is entirely possible that the cosmos (or the multiverse) is not caused

            1.1.1.4.2.3.2. Pro:
            "Anything that begins to exist has a cause" assumes two categories of things: things that begin and have a cause, and things that do not begin to exist and may or may not have a cause.

              1.1.1.4.2.3.2.1. Con:
              This is less an assumption and more a description of the original premise. It seems a simple logical necessity that these will be the categories which emerge from the idea that things cannot come into existence without a cause.

              1.1.1.4.2.3.2.2. Pro:
              If God is the only thing which exists in the category of 'things which do no begin to exist' then the initial premise is functionally identical to saying "Everything except God begins and must have a cause."

                1.1.1.4.2.3.2.2.1. Con:
                The KCA is compatible with the idea that multiple things exist eternally.

            1.1.1.4.2.3.3. Pro:
            Premise 2 of "The universe began to exist." positions the universe in one of the two categories established by premise 1.

              1.1.1.4.2.3.3.1. Pro:
              This is functionally identical to saying "The universe is not God".

            1.1.1.4.2.3.4. Con:
            There are physical entities, that would fall into the category of things that never begin to exist if they existed: a steady state universe, an eternally inflating multiverse, a closed time-like loop universe

            1.1.1.4.2.3.5. Con:
            There are metaphysical entities that would fall into the category of things that never began to exist if they existed such as abstract entities

            1.1.1.4.2.3.6. Con:
            There are theological entities of various religions that would fall into the category of things that never began to exist if they existed: multiple gods, a monotheistic or trinitarian God, impersonal forces such as Chaos or Order

            1.1.1.4.2.3.7. Con:
            Premise 2 indicates it is not assumed only God is in the category of things that do not begin to exist. The goal of the premise is to provide reasons for the claim that out of all possible cosmological models that do not imply a universe which begins to exist, none of them can in fact exist (reasons for this provided elsewhere)

            1.1.1.4.2.3.8. Con:
            Premise 3 ("If the Universe has a cause, the best candidate for that cause is the God of classical theism") shows that out of all theological and philosophical entities that do not begin to exist, that the God of classical theism is the best candidate. This still leaves open several possible candidates for which type of theist God exists

        1.1.1.4.3. Pro:
        The law of conservation of mass [71] states that mass cannot be created or destroyed. Given that mass does exist, and must have come into existence at some point, its cause must have broken this law and thus transcended the laws of physics. Such a cause could be considered God.

          1.1.1.4.3.1. Con:
          The Big Bang doesn't represent a point where matter (or energy) was created. There was no time prior to the Big Bang. Rather, the Big Bang is effectively the earliest point in the universe. Thus, it doesn't contradict the conservation of mass/energy.

          1.1.1.4.3.2. Con:
          Inflationary models of the universe posits a material that has a density that is "hard to dilute" (Max Tegmark, The Mathematical Universe). Such a material is a material with a negative pressure, which results in gravity having a repulsive effect (instead of an attractive one). When such a material expands, it gains mass from gravity (under E=mc^2).

          1.1.1.4.3.3. Con:
          Assuming that any massive change happened in a moment implies that natural processes had no time to take place, but there is no reason here to make such an assumption with regard to the formation of matter since science had proven that the process of matter being converted to and from energy has not in fact stopped happening.
          
          The existence of God is not supported by the claim that "there was a moment when all of the matter in the universe came into existence", as it still happens naturally.

          1.1.1.4.3.4. Con:
          The event known as the Big Bang is not accurately described as "matter that was shot outward" but rather as "energetic space that rapidly expanded" and in fact evidence indicates that it still continues to expand.

            1.1.1.4.3.4.1. Pro:
            Well known physical phenomena such as the formation of particles from in high energy space, the emergence of virtual particles in low energy space, and Hawking radiation, are various ways that matter is known to form, without any supernatural intervention required.

          1.1.1.4.3.5. Con:
          We do not know where all the matter/energy and space/time originally came from. 
          So one cannot claim that a God is responsible for this without arguing for (or claiming to know) the unknowable.

            1.1.1.4.3.5.1. Con:
            It does not follow that because some people believe that we do not know X, it is not possible to know X.

          1.1.1.4.3.6. Con:
          The statements, "mass and energy cannot be created or destroyed" and "God created all mass and energy" contradict each other.

            1.1.1.4.3.6.1. Con:
            These two statements do not contradict for the obvious reason that the first statement is clearly meant to apply to the laws of nature, which by definition are transcended by a supernatural God.

          1.1.1.4.3.7. Con:
          There are processes [72] through which, in rare circumstances, matter can be created from a vacuum, or nothing, depending upon what we define as nothing.

            1.1.1.4.3.7.1. Con:
            These processes are still part of a physical, natural order which demands explanation.

          1.1.1.4.3.8. Con:
          Matter may have always existed, so a creator is not necessary.

            1.1.1.4.3.8.1. Con:
            Any sufficient entity, such as a universe-creating pixie, would be considered God.

              1.1.1.4.3.8.1.1. Con:
              God is presumed to have some element that makes him worthy of faith. To attribute worthiness of faith to a being just because that being is extremely powerful would be arbitrary.

            1.1.1.4.3.8.2. Con:
            All of these solutions (except pixies) rely on the existence of a natural, physical order, which brings the question back to why such an order is in place. By definition, anything which can be the cause of the natural order is supernatural.

          1.1.1.4.3.9. Con:
          The law of conservation is for any closed system. Our universe is not a closed system. Black holes are removing matter and energy from the system at all times.

        1.1.1.4.4. Pro:
        The universe began to exist [73]. Anything that "begins to exist," must have a cause that explains how the thing came to exist.

          1.1.1.4.4.1. Con:
          The universe had to have come from somewhere. This leads to infinite ingress wherein each newly presumed creator of a creator is itself presumed to have its own creator.

            1.1.1.4.4.1.1. Con:
            The claim that 'a creator is itself presumed to have its own creator' is unsubstantiated. Eternal beings (as God would be) can very well be exempt from this general rule.

              1.1.1.4.4.1.1.1. Pro:
              If an uncaused eternal being (God) exists, then it is absurd to ask for the cause of that uncaused eternal being.

            1.1.1.4.4.1.2. Con:
            There is no reason to assume that the universe having come "from somewhere" leads to a loop. Among other things, this presumes atheism (as a divine creation would not involve a causal loop).

          1.1.1.4.4.2. Pro:
          The second premise of the Kalam cosmological argument [74], "the universe began to exist," was made more credible by the discovery of the Big Bang theory.

          1.1.1.4.4.3. Con:
          Even if our observable Universe is finite and came to exist at time zero: A) we know nothing and will probably continue to know nothing of what caused its existence (lack of explanation is better than any explanation in the total absence of evidence); and B) the hypothesis that beyond this Universe are other universes, potentially infinite in number and space-time, cannot be falsified.

          1.1.1.4.4.4. Pro:
          If it were possible for something to come into being without a cause, there is no reason why random objects such as chairs and soccer balls wouldn't pop into existence out of nowhere in empty space. After all, nothing has [75] no properties or constraints (e.g. "only makes universes").

            1.1.1.4.4.4.1. Con:
            If it is possible for nothing to cause something, it does not imply that random objects would necessarily pop into existence.

              1.1.1.4.4.4.1.1. Con:
              It seems like it would imply this actually. After all, the matter of our universe contains empty space/nothingness from which things can possibly pop into existence. However, given that nothing can have no properties there is no restriction on how often this can occur.

            1.1.1.4.4.4.2. Con:
            Virtual particles are shown to pop into existence out of nowhere in empty space (Krauss, Lawrence [76], 2012, A Universe from Nothing).

              1.1.1.4.4.4.2.1. Con:
              Virtual particles actually do have causes.

                1.1.1.4.4.4.2.1.1. Pro:
                Virtual particles are [77] "caused by the presence of other particles, often of other fields."

                1.1.1.4.4.4.2.1.2. Pro:
                Virtual particles do not emerge from nothing, rather they emerge from [78] changes in the arrangement of fields.

            1.1.1.4.4.4.3. Con:
            For something to happen without a cause is different from "nothing" behaving as a cause and causing something to happen, and "nothing has no properties or constraints" is only relevant to the latter construction.

          1.1.1.4.4.5. Con:
          The definition A5 is not preferable to the following alternative definition: x comes into being between times A and B iff x exists at time B and x does not exist at time A. By this definition, the universe did not come into existence, as there is no time A at which the universe did not exist. Moreover, on this definition, "if X comes into existence, x has a cause" is more plausible than on A5. Thus, we should reject A5 in favor of the above.

          1.1.1.4.4.6. Pro:
          No event can be truly "spontaneous", in the sense of lacking a cause. Even if they seem random, events are necessarily the result of their surroundings and of some external action.

            1.1.1.4.4.6.1. Con:
            If the assumption that spontaneous events were impossible was valid, every event would need a cause, meaning there could be no first event. It has already been assumed/shown in the proof from composition, that there must be a first event. Therefore spontaneous event, at least in the context of this discussion, must be possible.

              1.1.1.4.4.6.1.1. Con:
              In the context of the cosmological arguments, first events don't lack a cause. Instead, they are caused by an external entity, which is itself causeless.

                1.1.1.4.4.6.1.1.1. Con:
                If an external entity is causeless, it must be spontaneous, therefore making the external entity's existence a spontaneous event. Since a spontaneous event is necessary, to create this entity, there is no reason to believe the entity causing event would be any more likely then a universe creating event.

            1.1.1.4.4.6.2. Pro:
            Events [79] definitionally refer to objects, spatiotemporal contexts, and causal relationships. An event cannot occur without a cause.

          1.1.1.4.4.7. Con:
          It is possible that the universe came into being on its own.

            1.1.1.4.4.7.1. Pro:
            Before the universe existed, the laws of time, space, and causality may not have existed.

              1.1.1.4.4.7.1.1. Con:
              It is a completely speculative statement to say that the laws of time and space may not have existed.

            1.1.1.4.4.7.2. Pro:
            The laws of space and time did not exist before the universe was created, as neither space, nor time existed until the universe did.

              1.1.1.4.4.7.2.1. Con:
              This fact supports modal arguments that say the universe did not come into being on its own.

            1.1.1.4.4.7.3. Con:
            If at any point nothing existed, then nothing would exist at all.

              1.1.1.4.4.7.3.1. Pro:
              The universe could just be an illusion, i.e. it doesn't really exist.

              1.1.1.4.4.7.3.2. Con:
              A steady state universe would also require a cause, or else be causeless.

              1.1.1.4.4.7.3.3. Pro:
              In the entire history of observation there has never been an event that was not caused.

                1.1.1.4.4.7.3.3.1. Con:
                While this may be true, we cannot know it with certainty because we have not assessed every event that has ever occurred.

                1.1.1.4.4.7.3.3.2. Con:
                The problem of induction [80] calls into question whether this means uncaused events have never or will never happen.

            1.1.1.4.4.7.4. Pro:
            A vacuum is a very potent thing to create something. Modern physics shows [81] that there could apear something out of vacuum.

              1.1.1.4.4.7.4.1. Con:
              A vacuum already implies the existence of space.

              1.1.1.4.4.7.4.2. Con:
              This claim cites a source that indicates that a high powered laser can create particles in a vacuum. The claim is saying that the vacuum is creating the particles. Non sequitur. The fact that power is necessary to create matter from energy should fill you with awe considering the amount of power used to create the universe.

            1.1.1.4.4.7.5. Pro:
            Trying to explain the universe based on human experience alone is insufficient. At the time the cosmological argument began we had a very limited knowledge of how the world worked.

            1.1.1.4.4.7.6. Pro:
            The cosmological argument rests on a premise that is unsupported: "whatever begins to exist must have a cause". This is an unsuppprted assumption. We know there are quantum particles pop in and out of existence with no known cause, and we know that natural laws break down at singularity. The universe began at a singularity so you can't assume laws of the current universe dictate its behavior. It may or may not be possible for a singularity to change state with no cause, so the argument fails.

              1.1.1.4.4.7.6.1. Con:
              The cosmological argument does not require a thing to begin to exist, but to exist at all.

              1.1.1.4.4.7.6.2. Con:
              Lack of knowledge of the cause of quantum particles appearing does not count as evidence that they are non-caused.

            1.1.1.4.4.7.7. Pro:
            If causality did not exist, the universe would never have been caused to exist.

              1.1.1.4.4.7.7.1. Con:
              Causality is not something that logically could fail to exist because it is an abstract concept like evil.  Evil is essentially that which opposes the all powerful being whether there is any manifestation of it or not.  The concept exists.  Whether it applies to anything is another matter altogether.

              1.1.1.4.4.7.7.2. Con:
              The form of the parent argument contradicts itself. By explaining that the universe would not need a reason to exist, it gives a reason why the universe would not need a reason to exist.

            1.1.1.4.4.7.8. Con:
            The axiom of logic that states that effects have causes that precede them in a chain of causation is independent of physical laws, and as such remains in effect regardless of the status of the universe.

              1.1.1.4.4.7.8.1. Con:
              We assume effects have causes because this is what we see. It is not an axiom of logic which allows us to assume a cause without providing a reason to do so.

                1.1.1.4.4.7.8.1.1. Con:
                We do not in fact observe all causes for all effects.  We do in fact assume causes for all effects because effects would be unintelligible/inexplicable without them (i.e. no reason, cause, or ground for them to be).  Accordingly, the law of cause and effect is necessary for intelligible science.  Therefore, it is appropriately an axiom of logic because without it the universe is unintelligible.

                  1.1.1.4.4.7.8.1.1.1. Con:
                  The universe does not need to be intelligible, and science does not need to be true. The evidence suggests that in general they are, and they have proven useful, but that science is convenient is not a logical argument that it exists.

                  1.1.1.4.4.7.8.1.1.2. Con:
                  We have observed random events in the form of quantum mechanics. As we know random events exists, we know that there are events without a cause.

                    1.1.1.4.4.7.8.1.1.2.1. Con:
                    An event being random doesn't mean that it lacks a cause.

                      1.1.1.4.4.7.8.1.1.2.1.1. Con:
                      If events 1a and 1b are equally likely random events assuming event 1, event 1 may be considered a cause, but if a happens, that a happened, and b did not was not caused.

                    1.1.1.4.4.7.8.1.1.2.2. Con:
                    Quantum events do have a cause in the form of fluctuating fields and consistent, though imprecise, laws.

                      1.1.1.4.4.7.8.1.1.2.2.1. Con:
                      The causes of quantum events are partial, and insufficient to explain, or predict the event.

          1.1.1.4.4.8. Con:
          According to the b-theory [82] of time the universe has always existed.

          1.1.1.4.4.10. Pro:
          A universe (or temporarily ordered series of universes) that did not begin to exist is philosophically incoherent because it implies the formation of a concrete actual infinity by successive addition of events in time

            1.1.1.4.4.10.1. Con:
            That describes a universe which began to exist an infinite amount of time in the past, an idea which is indeed incoherent but is not identical with a universe that did not begin to exist.

            1.1.1.4.4.10.2. Pro:
            It is impossible to traverse an infinite number of past events of finite size. Consider:
            
            A. If one started today to count an infinite number of days, they will never reach the end of that sequence. Every day counted would leave them an infinite number of days away.
            
            B. In an infinitely old universe, a day must exist that is an infinite number of days prior to now. 
            
            These two statements are mutually-exclusive and cannot both be true, yet both must be true in an infinitely old universe.

              1.1.1.4.4.10.2.1. Con:
              B is false. Infinity is not a real number [83], and the number of days ago some particular day was can only be an integer.

                1.1.1.4.4.10.2.1.1. Con:
                Infinity and transfinite arithmetic are well defined in set theory [84]. A universe without beginning means the number of days is actually infinite (i.e. the cardinality is the same as the natural numbers). Therefore, starting from today (day 0) and counting backwards (day 1,2,3...) there must exist some day that will be labeled with the lowest infinite ordinal omega. That day or any day beyond it (omega+1, omega+2, ...) motivates saying there would be "an infinite number of days prior" to today.

                  1.1.1.4.4.10.2.1.1.1. Con:
                  That is assuming that a 'day' is a consistent form of measurement, which we know is incorrect as as you approach plank time the standard definitions of time and space cease to have meaning.

                    1.1.1.4.4.10.2.1.1.1.1. Con:
                    The planck time [85] is an extremely small amount of time, but the grandparent argument is talking about counting a series of 24-hour days, not shortening existing days. Thus, it is not clear how the days in the grandparent argument "approach planck time."

            1.1.1.4.4.10.3. Con:
            According to the b-theory [86] of time, all time exists at once and therefore there is no need to traverse it.

          The law of causality works within the universe, where time exists.

            1.1.1.4.4.11.1. Pro:
            Causes and effects are events in the universe. They occur at a given time, in a given place. There is no event where and when 'The universe began to exist'.

            1.1.1.4.4.11.2. Con:
            Cosmologists who consider multiverse theory assume that laws of causality still hold outside of our universe in the larger multiverse. In other words, they see no reason to offer a defense of the laws of causality when moving to a contexts where the laws of physics might be entirely different. This is suggestive that we all intuitively think of the law of causality as a metaphysical principle that applies to any physical reality and not just to our particular universe.

              1.1.1.4.4.11.2.1. Con:
              "Multiverse theory" is ill-specified. The many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics - the most prominent theory of a multiverse - implies universes with identical physical laws, so causality would obviously be present but not in a sense for which this argument would be relevant.

              1.1.1.4.4.11.2.2. Con:
              Any 'physical reality' would have matter and hence time. This confirms the claim that causality works within the universe, where time exists.

          1.1.1.4.4.12. Pro:
          The evidence in cosmology is best explained by Big Bang theory [87], which implies that our observable universe began to exist

            1.1.1.4.4.12.1. Pro:
            If our universe was infinitely old it would have undergone heat death long ago, and it hasn't.

              1.1.1.4.4.12.1.1. Con:
              Our universe would not be heat dead if it undergoes a cycle that restores it to a state of low entropy.

                1.1.1.4.4.12.1.1.1. Con:
                Without an external source of energy, such a cycle would lose energy after every iteration, like a basketball losing energy after every bounce unless it is being dribbled.
                
                After a long, but finite number of cycles, the universe would indeed suffer heat death. In an infinitely old universe, this would have happened an infinitely long time ago.

              1.1.1.4.4.12.1.2. Con:
              Our universe would not be heat dead if it didn't have activity for an infinitely long period of time (ie. by being quantum mechanically infinitesimally probable to suffer any change during it's infinitely long initial stage).

                1.1.1.4.4.12.1.2.1. Con:
                "Infinitely long" implies that time was existent during this time, which is philosophically impossible.

                1.1.1.4.4.12.1.2.2. Con:
                This ignores Brownian motion [88]. If the assertion is that even Brownian motion did not happen, then it appears that the universe was already in heat death.

            1.1.1.4.4.12.2. Pro:
            You say that there needed to be space, time, and matter for the big bang. Well, in Genesis 1:1 it says "In the beginning (time) God created the heavens (space) and the earth (matter)." You say our belief takes faith, well, so does yours. You weren't there when the big bang happened. And, to be honest, it takes more faith to believe that then it does to believe in an all powerful God.

            1.1.1.4.4.12.3. Pro:
            The evidence that God exists is overwhelming, not only on the basis of scripture but in the world around us even from the Big Bang, which is where God spoke the universe into existence through the Big Bang.

            1.1.1.4.4.12.4. Con:
            The second law [89] of thermodynamics has no known exceptions. The claim that the universe can bring the order we see around us from the disorder of the big bang is incompatible with this law.

              1.1.1.4.4.12.4.1. Con:
              Some versions of the Big Bang theory hypothesize that the Universe was compressed into a single particle just 13.8B years ago. The Second Law of Thermodynamics is limited to systems of many particles, so it would not apply in such a scenario. Thus, this law does not tell us what preceded such an event.

              1.1.1.4.4.12.4.2. Con:
              The second law is about the entropy of a closed system, however, the Earth is not a closed system as both mass and energy can enter or leave it (e.g. we continually receive radiation energy from the sun and lose helium to space.)

              1.1.1.4.4.12.4.3. Con:
              The above claim is comparable to saying that water cannot freeze because entropy would decrease. The fact is that it is possible to decrease entropy locally, it just has to be offset by a larger entropy increase in the whole system.

              1.1.1.4.4.12.4.4. Con:
              The entropy of the universe at the Big Bang was far lower than it is today. Thus, the universe today has more entropy than it did at the Big Bang and so the second law is not violated.

              1.1.1.4.4.12.4.5. Pro:
              The second law of thermodynamics indicates that the universe is running out of usable energy. If the universe had existed for an infinite number of past days, then all usable energy should have disappeared long ago.

                1.1.1.4.4.12.4.5.1. Con:
                The total amount of energy in the universe can be shown [90] to be 0. It simply not evenly distributed.

                  1.1.1.4.4.12.4.5.1.1. Con:
                  This is entirely consistent with a changing distribution of energy that makes less of it usable over time (i.e. entropy), so does not oppose the parent.

                1.1.1.4.4.12.4.5.2. Con:
                Scientists do not claim that the universe has existed for an infinite number of past days. The current estimate is about 13.8 billion years [91].

              1.1.1.4.4.12.4.6. Con:
              Entropy is not exactly a measure of disorder. Instead, it is a measure of the possible microstates of the system. The entropy of the early universe was lower than today, perfectly in agreement [92] with the second law of thermodynamics.

              1.1.1.4.4.12.4.7. Con:
              This claim is against the Big Bang, not in support of the existence of God.

            1.1.1.4.4.12.5. Con:
            Cosmologists propose a beginning for the current timeline of the universe, not for the universe as a whole.

              1.1.1.4.4.12.5.1. Con:
              It is unclear that there is a meaningful distinction between "current timeline of the universe" and "the universe as a whole."

                1.1.1.4.4.12.5.1.1. Con:
                The current timeline of the universe is defined as events which occurred since the rapid expansion. It is not known if the universe as a whole extend beyond this point. The current timeline is the universe as we know it today, whereas the universe as a whole may possibly extend past that point.

                  1.1.1.4.4.12.5.1.1.1. Con:
                  The "compact universe" before its expansion still needs a cause for its existance.

                  1.1.1.4.4.12.5.1.1.2. Con:
                  The universe's expansion requires a cause. Otherwise it would have stayed in its state.

            Even if the age of the universe is finite (which we do not know), that would not suggest or support in any way the existence of a god.

            1.1.1.4.4.12.7. Con:
            The argument uses misleading language, as 'began to exist' does not mean what one would think it does.

            There is at least one cosmological model that does not hold that the universe began to exist and is better supported by current evidence.

              The Gott-Li model (Closed Timelike Curves) [94] does not hold that the universe began to exist.

              1.1.1.4.4.12.8.3. Con:
              If there is a cosmological model of a universe with an infinite past, that is better supported by current evidence, it would replace the Big Bang as the mainstream theory.

              1.1.1.4.4.12.8.4. Con:
              Multiverse theories fail by every philosophical measure.

                1.1.1.4.4.12.8.4.1. Pro:
                Multiverse theories have low explanatory scope, since they don't explain any data other than the fine-tuning of the universe. In contrast, theism explains the existence of the universe and of objective morality, as well as many miracle claims and subjective experiences.

                  1.1.1.4.4.12.8.4.1.1. Con:
                  The multiverse theory can be treated as part of a larger philosophy of naturalism that also aims to explain all things theism attempts to explain. Then they would have the same explanatory scope.

                1.1.1.4.4.12.8.4.2. Pro:
                Multiverse theories are very unparsimonious, since they posit a bafflingly large number of entire universes that cannot be observed. Theism only proposes a single extra entity.

                  1.1.1.4.4.12.8.4.2.1. Con:
                  This assumes parsimony concerns limiting the number of entities as opposed to the number of types of entities. God would represent a significantly distinct class of entities not present in naturalism. Many people's intuitions may consider this less parsimonious than adding more universes like our own.

                1.1.1.4.4.12.8.4.3. Pro:
                Multiverse theories are ad hoc, since the existence of causally disconnected universes isn't very plausibly supported outside of its use as an answer to fine-tuning. Theism is supported by other arguments, as well as by the subjective experiences of many.

                  1.1.1.4.4.12.8.4.3.1. Con:
                  Max Tegmark's mathematical universe hypothesis [95] gives a philosophical framework for the nature of existence that implies a form of multiverse.

                    It's not clear that consciousness can be simulated by purely mathematical processes.

                      The Chinese room argument [96] holds that simulating consciousness within non-conscious systems is impossible.

                          By Occam's Razor [97] (parsimony) there would be no need for the additional entity of conscious experience to explain the behavior of the machine or Room.

                        The Chinese room thought experiment demonstrates an entity that is incapable of performing a task, speaking Chinese, can have components added that allow it to appear to perform this task. It extends this argument to say the same is true of computers that appear conscious. However, this ignores that the thing between the first entity, and the audience, is itself an entity. And this entity as a whole can perform this task, thus could be considered conscious.

                      1.1.1.4.4.12.8.4.3.1.1.2. Pro:
                      Quantum mechanics has shown [98] that consciousness isn't describable by purely physical processes.

                  1.1.1.4.4.12.8.4.3.2. Con:
                  Multiverse theories build on principles of cosmology developed and verified while explaining various phenomena within our universe. Therefore, extending these ideas to explain the phenomena of fine-tuning and the origin of our universe is motivated hypothesis building as opposed to pure ad hoc stipulation.

                Multiverse theories have low explanatory power: P1. A perfectly random system is more likely to produce simpler results than more complex ones P2. There are simpler possible universes than ours which contain conscious beings P3. We should expect to find ourselves in the most common situation that produces observers (Copernican principle) C. Under multiverse theories, our existence in this universe is unlikely

                  1.1.1.4.4.12.8.4.4.1. Pro:

                  The universe looks complex to us because we are a part of it, and one can't accurately, and completely model something they are a part of

                    This doesn't show that the universe is not complex or that simpler, consciousness-producing universes cannot exist.

                    1.1.1.4.4.12.8.4.4.2.2. Con:
                    One doesn't need a complete or fully accurate model of something in order to judge its complexity.

                      1.1.1.4.4.12.8.4.4.2.2.1. Con:
                      If our brains were so simple that we could understand them, we would be so simple that we could not understand them, because this is an example of something trying to model itself. Any model that we could make would need to necessarily be quite crude, because an accurate one would need to be all encompassing, and anything we want to model that can model itself needs to be able to do other things.

                        1.1.1.4.4.12.8.4.4.2.2.1.1. Con:
                        This statement isn't true in all possible worlds. In a universe with different laws, much simpler intelligent systems are conceivably possible.

                          1.1.1.4.4.12.8.4.4.2.2.1.1.1. Con:
                          Suppose a computer has a total of N possible states. Suppose there is something outside of the computer in the universe, so the universe has at least N+1 possible states. With zero overhead, each state of the computer can correspond to a state of the universe, but since the universe has more states than the computer, some states of the universe will map to the same state of the computer, in which case the simulation will not be able to distinguish between them.

                  1.1.1.4.4.12.8.4.4.3. Con:
                  Just because there are simpler "possible" universes than ours does not mean that the universe is all that complicated. The rules guiding this universe are relatively simple.

                  A simpler model that allows for sentient beings has not been presented.

                    A Boltzmann Brain [99] type universe allows for sentient beings and is simpler than the multiverse.

                  1.1.1.4.4.12.8.4.4.5. Con:
                  Multiverse models are not required to be completely random in the universes they generate. They can, in principle, have motivated constraints on the types of universes generated within the multiverse which would lead to universes like ours being among the most probable.

                1.1.1.4.4.12.8.4.5. Pro:
                Multiverse theories are unfalsifiable, since it is impossible by definition for a causally disconnected universe to interact with our own. Theism is at least possibly falsifiable, since God would be able to interact with the universe.

                  1.1.1.4.4.12.8.4.5.1. Con:
                  The multiverse theory predicts [100] that the vacuum energy is probably nearly as far from zero as possible for a universe capable of supporting sentient life, whereas a single finely-tuned universe ought to have it at exactly zero; this constitutes a testable prediction.

                    1.1.1.4.4.12.8.4.5.1.1. Con:
                    There is no reason to assume that a creator would be compelled to make the vacuum energy zero.

                  1.1.1.4.4.12.8.4.5.2. Con:
                  Most multiverse models allow for causal interaction between universes. At the very least there is interaction between our universe and the universe within/from which our universe arose. Depending on this process, various marks might be left on our universe to hint at what came before. No such evidence has been observed allowing us to falsify various multiverse models.

            1.1.1.4.4.12.9. Pro:
            Naive extrapolation of the Big Bang theory back in time implies a singularity in the past for our universe

              1.1.1.4.4.12.9.1. Con:
              Big Bang theory is based on theories of physics that do not apply at the energy scales attained during the earliest moments of the universe (e.g. Planck time). Therefore the retrodictions of Big Bang theory all the way to a singularity are not reliable.

                1.1.1.4.4.12.9.1.1. Con:
                If the retrodictions of Big Bang theory are considered unreliable because time breaks down completely, then one still has a universe which begins to exist

                  There is no sense in which the Plank era can be said to 'precede' the classical universe and so our universe still has a beginning

                  1.1.1.4.4.12.9.1.1.2. Pro:
                  Currently, no physical model exists for explaining how our classical universe, which has a well-defined notion of time, could emerge from or be causally connected to a Planck era in which time has completely broken down (Deltete & Guy 1996 [101]). So this Planck era is indistinguishable from an independent universe, leaving our universe with a beginning

                1.1.1.4.4.12.9.1.2. Con:
                If the retrodictions of Big Bang theory are considered unreliable because time is modified, we have no plausible reason to believe physics changes so dramatically as to avoid a beginning

            1.1.1.4.4.12.10. Con:
            The Big Bang Theory [102] postulates the earliest know periods of our observable universe [103] however "Physicists are undecided whether this means the universe began from a singularity, or that current knowledge is insufficient to describe the universe at that time." As such arguing that our universe began, when prevailing science does not claim it, is unsound.

          1.1.1.4.4.13. Con:
          The phrase "begins to exist" cannot be adequately defined such that it applies to the universe but not to God (see Bobier 2013 [104] or this blog [105] summarizing the paper)

            1.1.1.4.4.13.1. Con:
            A theist could allow God to be temporally prior to the universe (i.e. time exists before the universe), which would cause the article's [106] objection to BTE2 ("X begins to exist at T1 iff (i) X exists at T1 and (ii) there is no time prior to T1 at which X exists"), to fail.

            1.1.1.4.4.13.2. Pro:
            X's being is a tensed fact defined in terms of x becoming in a temporal sense. This is circular as 'temporal becoming' is the same as 'beginning'.

          1.1.1.4.4.14. Con:
          Using the above linked definition of 'begins to exist', the universe did not begin to exist. Time exists within the universe (as a direction in spacetime), and not the other way around. Therefore it doesn't make sense to say 'The universe exists at time t.'

          1.1.1.4.4.15. Con:
          A5 [107] is not the natural definition of 'began to exist'. (A1 is the natural definition). Definition A5 was deliberately created so that the Kalam cosmological argument could retain its appealing-to-common-sense form [108].

            1.1.1.4.4.15.1. Con:
            A5 may be philosophically technical but it has to be in order to capture all the various usages of phrases like "begins to exist", "the creation of", or "came into existence" that appear in various popular sources discussing cosmology as well as our mundane usage in everyday life. One can find this phrase being used in a non-A1 sense by cosmologists [109] (skip to 5:40) or generic science blogs [110] with no interest in the Kalam argument

          1.1.1.4.4.16. Con:
          There is no support for this argument beyond human intuition, and human intuition is known to be unreliable in many fields of study.

            1.1.1.4.4.16.1. Con:
            The support for all beliefs, philosophical and scientific, eventually work their way down to fundamental intuitions for which no external evidence can be offered.

            1.1.1.4.4.16.2. Con:
            While one can safely question/disregard the philosophical intuitions of a single person or small group of people, to give no credence to the shared philosophical intuitions of large groups of sincere thinkers, if not the majority of thinkers in this case, undermines rational inquiry.

              1.1.1.4.4.16.2.1. Pro:
              "All things that begin to exist require a cause" is assumed true in all other other notable contexts. In other words, there is no independent case in either philosophy or science where this principle is not assumed true by the majority

                1.1.1.4.4.16.2.1.1. Con:
                We have no other examples besides the universe of anything that "began to exist" in the same sense - that is, to come into being as opposed to being rearranged from existing matter. Thus this statement about "all other notable contexts" is false or vacuously true [111].

                  1.1.1.4.4.16.2.1.1.1. Con:
                  "X begins to exist" vs "X is the product of a rearrangement of matter" is a false dichotomy. Plenty of things begin to exist (using A5). For example, the computer I am using right now came into being when it was made.

                    1.1.1.4.4.16.2.1.1.1.1. Con:
                    The fact that A5 does not draw a distinction between things which begin to exist as a rearrangement of existing atoms and things which begin to exist without preexisting matter is true, but irrelevant, and in no way indicates that to draw such a distinction is a false dichotomy.

                1.1.1.4.4.16.2.1.2. Pro:
                The existence of something that has a beginning or is contingent, but yet does not have a cause has never been observed.

                1.1.1.4.4.16.2.1.3. Con:
                'Begins to exist' is an arbitrary definition. A cup does not begin to exist, it comes from something else. A cup is made from glass, which is made from silicon, which is mined, which is.... everything we have observed has a precursor.

                  1.1.1.4.4.16.2.1.3.1. Con:
                  Before the glass was formed into a cup, the cup didn't exist, all there was was glass. It seems counterintuitive to refer to a chunk of glass as a "cup" simply because it will be made into a cup in the future. Since there was no cup when it was still glass, and there was a cup after the glass was shaped into a cup, the cup began to exist at a specific, well-defined point.

                1.1.1.4.4.16.2.1.4. Con:
                Quantum theory postulates [112] that things pop in and out of existence, no cause known. To say that everything that begins must have a cause when it cannot be identified that some things have a cause is an extrapolation without evidence. Claiming that 'everything that begins to exist has a cause' is therefore unsound.

                  1.1.1.4.4.16.2.1.4.1. Con:
                  This is a common misconception [113] about virtual particles in quantum theory. They have a known cause, namely fluctuations in the underlying quantum fields. In the case of vacuum fluctuations, they are caused by the vacuum state not being just a 0-particle eigenstate of the various quantum fields in space (wikipedia [114])

                  1.1.1.4.4.16.2.1.4.2. Con:
                  To say "All things that begin to exist must have a cause", does not require all things have a deterministic cause (e.g. identical initial conditions always cause the same effect). It is consistent with things having indeterministic causes such as those postulated in some interpretations of quantum mechanics

            1.1.1.4.4.16.3. Con:
            This fails to distinguish gut reactions (e.g. this person seems untrustworthy) and intuitive speculation (e.g. the stock market is going to go up) from philosophical intuitions (e.g. the people I experience have minds like my own). Most evidence of "human intuition" being unreliable covers only the first two cases.

          The rejection of this principle undermines science as it becomes acceptable to hypothesize that a given phenomena (e.g. unexpected galaxy rotation curves, photons beginning to exist during radioactive decays, species distributions across continents, changes in atmospheric temperatures) lacks a cause

            1.1.1.4.4.18.1. Con:
            Something can be unacceptable to hypothesise in science without being impossible in principle; this is the situation of the supernatural under methodological naturalism.

            1.1.1.4.4.18.2. Con:
            This is not strictly correct. You can have causes without beginnings. One can cause a rock to move. This does not presuppose the rock 'beginning' simply that it exists at the time of intervention.

              1.1.1.4.4.18.2.1. Con:
              This is not an example of a cause without a beginning because when one causes a rock to move, the motion of the rock begins.

              Assuming the stone was obsidian, you can then trace the steps of it's existence back. Obsidian comes about from molten silica, and you can continue the step-wise path all the way back to Planck time [115]. At which point our methods of observing the universe crease to have any meaning.

            1.1.1.4.4.18.3. Con:
            Anything within the universe obeys cause and effect, but that doesn't mean the universe as an entire entity obeys cause and effect.

                By using Occhams Razor the simplest explanation suggests only one set of natural laws, and there being no ‘outside’ of the universe.

                1.1.1.4.4.18.3.1.3. Pro:

              1.1.1.4.4.18.3.2. Con:
              The universe as a physical entity needs to obey the laws of logic and physics like the law of cause and effect, to be considered a physical entity

                Just like a particle or a wave needs a cause [117] for it's existence, so does the universe.

          'Beginning' is a human definition, there is no objective nature to this term. As the definition is subjective in nature saying the universe 'began' is not specific enough to be useful.

            1.1.1.4.4.19.1. Pro:
            For example it could be defined that the universe began at the big bang, or at the point that time is measurable (post plank time).

        1.1.1.4.5. Pro:
        If a universe that begins to exist is not preceded by some prior universe that can serve as its cause, the cause of that universe must be timeless, spaceless, and immaterial

          1.1.1.4.5.1. Pro:
          If the cause of the universe is timeless, it must have a will in order to be able to exist in a timeless state and act as the cause of a single universe (or finite number of universes).

            1.1.1.4.5.1.1. Con:

            A non-personal cause of the Universe (e.g. quantum vacuum fluctuation) can only create an infinite number of universes or no universe. This is because a non-personal cause is defined such that it always acts when a set of sufficient antecedent conditions is met. In a timeless state, if those conditions are ever met, then they are always met and such a non-personal cause would generate an infinite number of universes.

              1.1.1.4.5.1.3.1. Con:

              The claim that a 'will' existed, sans matter, or pre the cause of the universe and the matter present in our observable space time is inconsistent with general observations and science.

          The cause of the universe (our observable space-time) must precede time, as time is subject to matter and matter, in our space-time, came into being after and during the Big Bang [122]. This does not suggest that the cause is timeless or immaterial, simple not dependent on our space-time.

            1.1.1.4.5.2.1. Pro:
            There are naturalistic explanations [123]for the origin of the universe which do not require the assumption of the supernatural.

          1.1.1.4.5.3. Pro:
          The cause of the universe must be eternal. It is as reasonable to believe that that eternal thing is God than it is to believe it is a multiverse.

            1.1.1.4.5.3.1. Con:
            "It is no more reasonable to believe that eternal thing is God than it is to believe it is a Multiverse," is an unwarranted conclusion. It assumes there is no warrant for belief in God outside of the cosmological argument. One would have to do a full survey of evidence for God and the multiverse and make a comparison between these before this conclusion is warranted.

            1.1.1.4.5.3.2. Con:
            The multi-verse also requires a cause of its own. The problem of a cause has only been pushed back further by invoking a multiverse.

              1.1.1.4.5.3.2.1. Con:
              It is not logical to argue that only God is permitted to be un-caused. What justification is there to attach a requirement of cause to the Multiverse but not to God? To do so merely favors one prime mover over the other and states the purely speculative as fact.

        1.1.1.4.6. Con:
        There is no reason to believe a single being existed over a number of beings. The existence of multiple such creators would run counter to the definition of a classical God.

          1.1.1.4.6.1. Con:
          Ockham's razor would support favoring a single being.

          1.1.1.4.6.2. Con:
          The definition of God as "that than which nothing greater can be conceived" describes an essentially unique, non-contingent being. Thus, there can be only one God.

            1.1.1.4.6.2.1. Con:
            This is clearly incomplete. The definition ensures there cannot be more than one. But says nothing about whether such a one exists.

            1.1.1.4.6.2.2. Con:
            There could be more than one, if we could conceive of 2 supreme beings who, while they differ in some respect, we cannot conceive of a higher being.

              1.1.1.4.6.2.2.1. Pro:
              Consider regular and dark matter. We thought that regular matter was the whole of the universe, now we know that is not true.

          1.1.1.4.6.3. Con:
          If there is not One Supreme Being to have existed before time, there would be nowhere for "gods" to have come from.

        1.1.1.4.7. Con:
        God is not the best candidate for the cause of the universe. Instead, the cause is better delineated by naturalistic explanations.

          1.1.1.4.7.1. Pro:
          If the Universe has a cause ('prime mover'), there is no justification to attribute that cause with 'unmoved', 'uncaused' etc., since that something may have pertained to another, predating Universe or 'realm', where it was in turned caused by something, etc. Infinite causation is possible in infinite time-space.

          1.1.1.4.7.2. Pro:
          Ekpyrotic cosmologies [124], string cosmology [125], quantum gravity models [126], chaotic inflationary models [127], vacuum fluctuation models [128], and oscillating models [129] provide a cause for our universe.

          1.1.1.4.7.3. Pro:
          Hawking, in his collection of essays, "Black Holes and Baby Universes," suggests that matter collapsing into a singularity in one Universe could poke a hole in space-time and explode into a new Universe.

            From Hawking [130]: “There is no baby universe branching off, as I once thought. The information remains firmly in our universe. I’m sorry to disappoint science fiction fans, but if information is preserved, there is no possibility of using black holes to travel to other universes.”

      Cosmological arguments commit the God of the gaps [131] fallacy.

        1.1.1.5.1. Con:
        Science may one day explain things that we currently have no explanation for other than "God did it," but science is equally likely to reveal new concepts and topics that seem inexplicable without God.

          1.1.1.5.1.1. Pro:
          Past scientific discoveries have uncovered facts about the universe that are more difficult to explain without God.

        1.1.1.5.2. Pro:
        Cosmological argumentation is speculation in the entire lack of data. Any explanation may be proffered, but until there is actual data about the singularity preceding the appearance of our Universe, no explanation will always be better than any.

        1.1.1.5.3. Pro:
        Cosmological arguments arrive at a God that is not shown to be necessary. One could posit any sufficient entity and it would be just as valid. Universe creating pixies that disappear after creating the cosmos are just as sufficient.

          1.1.1.5.3.2. Pro:
          Consider two identical universes, one with God and the other without. If no distinction can be made between the two universes, then the existence of a deity does not hold any explanatory power.

            1.1.1.5.3.2.1. Pro:
            As adding God into our worldview adds nothing in terms of making sense of the universe/nature, it is an unnecessary hypothesis and would be removed by Occam's Razor.

            1.1.1.5.3.2.2. Con:
            Positing the existence of an otherwise identical Godless reality to show that God is not necessary in our reality is a circular argument. It requires the assumption that God is not necessary for all realities to prove that assumption.

              1.1.1.5.3.2.2.1. Con:
              The argument involving two identical realities exemplifies that the claimed necessity of God, as well as claims that God is unnecessary, are bald and are presumed. To say God is or is not necessary requires more than lipservice. Since we can discard mere lipservice, we're left with the dilemma that each hypothetical universe is identical in all other respects. That means there's no experience or feature of reality that can stand to tell us the kind of universe we actually live in.

              1.1.1.5.3.2.2.2. Con:
              This argument itself is a circular argument. It assumes that to show that God exists, one has to exlude from consideration all realities where God doesn't exist.

            1.1.1.5.3.2.3. Con:
            The posited consideration requires the assumption that we collectively understand enough about the universe to model its behavior in entirety.

            1.1.1.5.3.2.4. Con:
            This argument is incoherent, because it suggests one to think of two identical universes that are different from each other. It is impossible to be identical and different at the same time.

          1.1.1.5.3.3. Con:
          The Aristotelian argument from the Act/Potency divide does in fact show that a god meeting the formal definition of God, is necessary.

        1.1.1.5.4. Pro:
        Throughout history, human beings have attributed events they did not understand to God. For example, natural events like thunder were interpreted as supernatural phenomena.

          1.1.1.5.4.1. Pro:
          God is an attempt to answer questions that our brain is not capable of answering at the moment, rather than a real thing that has existed since the beginning of time.

          1.1.1.5.4.2. Con:
          That some religious ideas were later explained by science does not ensure that all religious ideas will be explained by science in the future.

          1.1.1.5.4.3. Pro:
          We have lots of proofs about the no necessity of a god, and they increase during the years. In the same way, we have no proofs of its existence or necessity for life.

          1.1.1.5.4.4. Pro:
          Natural events have been regarded as a sign from God and, consequently, natural calamities are regarded as punishment from God.

            1.1.1.5.4.4.1. Pro:
            God sent incessant rains to flood the earth [132] as punishment for the sins of humanity. Then, he created a rainbow as a sign that he will keep his promises to Noah.

            Rain is often considered as a sign of blessing from God [133], as demonstrated by phrases such as "showers of blessing."

            1.1.1.5.4.4.3. Con:
            In Matthew 5:45 [134], Jesus says, "He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous."

          1.1.1.5.4.5. Pro:
          God was the catch-all hypothesis that allowed rationality to take hold in primitive eras, when no alternative model was available. Over time, religion was replaced by philosophy, then by science. Thus, God is a necessary cognitive step in the genealogy of knowledge.

          1.1.1.5.4.6. Pro:
          Human beings fear what they do not understand, as this makes it difficult to predict and avoid danger. Therefore, human beings have evolved to not accept claims based on ignorance.

        1.1.1.5.5. Con:
        The alternative is a homunculus fallacy, in which nature is explained in purely naturalistic terms, resulting in an infinite regress of causes.

          1.1.1.5.5.1. Con:
          One must demonstrate the absolute impossibility of an infinite regress of causality before dismissing it.

          1.1.1.5.5.2. Con:
          It is reasonable to search for naturalistic explanations until a phenomenon is demonstrated to actually be caused by supernatural event. We have never observed anything to be caused supernaturally, we don't have the means to determine so, nor do we know if it is possible in the first place.

            1.1.1.5.5.2.1. Con:
            The premise "we have never observed anything to be caused supernaturally" may not be true. According to some religions, supernatural occurrences such as Jesus walking on water and Mohammad splitting the moon were supernatural events that were observed.

            1.1.1.5.5.2.2. Con:
            It is not reasonable to search for a naturalistic explanation for nature itself. Entities can be uncaused (or eternal), but not self-caused. A supernatural explanation for nature would be more reasonable.

            1.1.1.5.5.2.3. Con:
            Saying we can’t know a supernatural event occured dismisses revelation a priori as a source of knowledge. It cannot be empirically verified (like all personal hypotheses), but it can be known through revelation. Infinite regresses however cannot be empirically verified either, so it would be inconsistent to claim on these grounds that it is more reasonable.

          1.1.1.5.5.3. Pro:
          An infinite regress of causes would result in a past-eternal universe and that concept runs contrary to observation. If the universe is dying, which is not controversial, it already should have died if it is the result of an infinite regress of causes.

        1.1.1.5.6. Con:
        To say that science has explained some things previously attributed to God and therefore God is unnecessary for existence is a hasty generalization. Science would have to prove that God is not needed for the universe to exist before this argument is valid.

        1.1.1.5.7. Con:
        The claim that science will one day be able to explain the gaps is a post dated cheque. It's an empty promise.

          1.1.1.5.7.1. Pro:
          You wouldn't sell your house to someone and hand over the deed of ownership if they had given you a post dated cheque, so why should we believe the scientists when they say they will one day be able to explain how consciousness is produced as an epiphenomenon of matter, how life came to be, or how the universe originated?

          1.1.1.5.7.2. Pro:
          The progress science has made in explaining the gaps can be compared to the progress Olympic athletes have made in extending human abilities. I could claim I'm going to jump over the moon one day, and I can give as evidence the fact that yesterday I was able to jump 2ft, and today I can jump 4ft therefore tomorrow I will jump over the moon. There is a limit to how high humans can jump, in the same way there is a limit to how much science can explain within a materialistic framework.

        1.1.1.5.8. Con:
        Even if true this claim does not disprove Gods existence because God by definition eludes the scope of science. Science could come up with a complete description of how the world is functioning, and the possibility still remains that God could have made it that way.

          1.1.1.5.8.1. Con:
          However, if true this would still undermine cosmological arguments as positive evidence for God, thus weakening the case for theism.

        1.1.1.5.9. Pro:
        Everything that science cannot explain [135] might be considered as evidence for the existence of God. This is called the God-of-the-gaps reasoning.

          1.1.1.5.9.1. Con:
          The First Cause argument [136] is an example of this fallacy.

          1.1.1.5.9.2. Pro:
          If God does not exist, there is no way to know for sure because we can never know everything, and of all the things we don't know at any given time, God can always be one of them.

            1.1.1.5.9.2.1. Con:
            The following reasoning is invalid: "we cannot know x because we do not know everything, and x could be one of those things we do not know". Indeed, if you inspect an empty glass, you can know that there is no gnome in it, despite there being other things you do not know.

            1.1.1.5.9.2.2. Con:
            We can never "know for sure" anything about the universe, because senses and memory are fallible. A correct understanding of what it means for a human to know something requires a degree of uncertainty - and it is possible in principle to "know" with that degree of uncertainty that God does no exist.

            1.1.1.5.9.2.3. Pro:
            This being true makes positive atheism (the belief that God does not exist) totally irrational, leaving the only rational position for someone who has not seen good evidence for God's existence a neutral one.

              1.1.1.5.9.2.3.1. Pro:
              To be consistent with this logical fact attitudes on religion must be restricted to those for which the burden of proof can be met. This means that a lack of respect for theologies and religious practices which enrich people's lives cannot be justified, and the only reasonable position is to be open to the possibility that the teachings are true.

              1.1.1.5.9.2.3.2. Pro:
              A neutral stance would involve acceptance of the possibility that some of the various religions on offer may contain some truth. This would be similar to how many scientists believe it's possible aliens exist, while believing it's possible they don't.

            1.1.1.5.9.2.4. Pro:
            However if in fact God does exist, then he can reveal him self to us, and his existence could thus be known to us as a self-evident [137] truth.

              1.1.1.5.9.2.4.1. Pro:
              Numerous people claim to have had experiences which indicate God's existence.

              1.1.1.5.9.2.4.2. Con:
              The linked source states that claims of a self-evident nature are the foundation upon which you make arguments. To use the Existence of God as a self-evident proof of the existence of God is disingenuous as you cannot build upon this claim. In other words the linked source says you cannot use a claim of self-evidence to prove said self-evident claim.

                1.1.1.5.9.2.4.2.1. Con:
                The evidence functions as proof to the one who has had the experience in the same way that I can experience the benefits of eating food in a self-evident manner.

                  1.1.1.5.9.2.4.2.1.1. Pro:
                  If I am seeing the sun rise nobody is going to be able to convince that it's still night because the experience of the sunrise is self evident. God can reveal Himself to a specific individual in a similar way.

            1.1.1.5.9.2.5. Con:
            Just because something cannot be disproved does not validate the claim. This would be an argument from ignorance [138].

          1.1.1.5.9.3. Pro:
          A God which does not manifest in reality and is not evidenced by reality is indistinguishable from a God which does not exist.

            1.1.1.5.9.3.1. Con:
            It is question begging to equate "reality" with empirical reality. To assume that physical reality covers the whole of reality is to presume that non-physical beings (such as God) do not exist.

              1.1.1.5.9.3.1.1. Con:
              This question-begging assumption only exists on a misreading: "Is indistinguishable from" is not the same thing as "is".

                1.1.1.5.9.3.1.1.1. Con:
                To assume that a pronouncement of "indistinguishable from" is valid, after only considering the empirical, is to assume either an epistomolical or an ontological materialism. That is, it commits the same basic error.

              1.1.1.5.9.3.1.2. Pro:
              Many believers claim that God is really manifest to them on a spritual level. Until these claims have been shown to be universally false, it cannot be said that God "does not manifest in reality".

            1.1.1.5.9.3.2. Con:
            This argument, while logical, is not commensurate with reality because there is in fact evidence of God's hand in the world in several phenomenona.

              1.1.1.5.9.3.2.1. Con:
              A lack of an explanation is exactly that. It isn't logical to attribute everything unexplainable to God.

                1.1.1.5.9.3.2.1.1. Con:
                Intelligent design meets all the criteria required of a scientific explanation. Any argument which is capable of defeating intelligent design has unintended consequences if applied across the board. For example, it is claimed that Intelligent design is not a scientific theory because it invokes an unobserved force. Darwinian evolution also invokes an observed force.

                1.1.1.5.9.3.2.1.2. Pro:
                This is just the "God of the gaps [139]" fallacy. It invents an agentic explanation for an unexplained observation.

              1.1.1.5.9.3.2.2. Pro:
              Mathematical improbabilities associated with the fine tuning of the laws of physics, the fine tuning of our planet and eco systems, and the immense unliklihood of mutations in genes leading to beneficial changes all provide data for which God is the best possible explanation.

                1.1.1.5.9.3.2.2.1. Con:
                While 50% of Americans still do not accept the theory of evolution, it is now also considered a fact [140] by numerous national and international scientific bodies.

                1.1.1.5.9.3.2.2.2. Con:
                Thinking in probabilities, it is quite easy to understand how Earth ended up with life.

                  1.1.1.5.9.3.2.2.2.1. Pro:
                  Routinely, people win state lotteries; it is in fact a common occurrence. While the odds of any one ticket-holder winning are astronomically against, as more tickets are sold, the chance that someone will win increases. There are trillions of planets in the universe, and as it happens, the right events happened to support life on Earth. Some planet(s) was bound to win, and it was this one (at least).

                1.1.1.5.9.3.2.2.3. Con:
                It is true that most mutations are not beneficial; some are harmful, many have no apparent effect, but occasionally some are good. It happens with sets of genes that have been mutating in parallel as well.

                  1.1.1.5.9.3.2.2.3.1. Pro:
                  From a sheer volume of evidence standpoint, there is no other theory in science that even comes remotely close to having the the amount and variety of supporting evidence that evolution has.

                    1.1.1.5.9.3.2.2.3.1.1. Con:
                    Perhaps a more valid statement would be to say there is no theory which has had more of its so called evidence turn out to be either false or an out right hoax. Furthermore no other theory has had its false evidence [141] and hoax evidence remain in textbooks after being exposed to the extent that the theory of Evolution has.

                      1.1.1.5.9.3.2.2.3.1.1.1. Con:
                      Critique of Wells at talkorigins [142].

                    1.1.1.5.9.3.2.2.3.1.2. Con:
                    The above statement can be considered true only with a very sketchy use of the word evidence. That is to say if you lump hoaxs, evidence that later turned out to be false, and evidence which is used to argue for evolution but which is in actualoty is a non-sequitur as evidence then you can amass a large volume of "evidence".

                    1.1.1.5.9.3.2.2.3.1.3. Pro:
                    There are hundreds [143] of fossils of transitional species of hominids that preceded humans.

                  1.1.1.5.9.3.2.2.3.2. Pro:
                  This has been observed in the laboratory [144] at Michigan State University.

                  1.1.1.5.9.3.2.2.3.3. Pro:
                  This has been observed in bacteria that becomes resistant to antibiotics.

                  1.1.1.5.9.3.2.2.3.4. Pro:
                  This has been observed in the wing color of the British peppered moth [145].

                  1.1.1.5.9.3.2.2.3.5. Pro:
                  This notion aligns with the fact that our DNA shows how all life on Earth is linked to together. While mutations are random, their selection is not.

                  1.1.1.5.9.3.2.2.3.6. Pro:
                  The evolution [146] of wolves to dogs is beyond question.

                  1.1.1.5.9.3.2.2.3.7. Pro:
                  The route of the laryngeal nerve in giraffes [147] is powerful evidence of evolution.

          1.1.1.5.9.4. Pro:
          Any gap in understanding that is filled by God only creates a higher level gap - namely "How did God come to exist?" Using God to fill the gap is the equivalent of using "magic" to explain a process we don't understand.

            1.1.1.5.9.4.1. Con:
            God does not possess the qualities of something which was created because He doesn't have a beginning, He doesn't have moving parts and He is capable of manifesting His own existence.

            1.1.1.5.9.4.2. Con:
            In any explanation there is going to be something inconceivable, God is the better candidate for this position because when we accept God's powers then everything else becomes explainable but on naturalism we find inconceivable things all over the place.

              1.1.1.5.9.4.2.1. Pro:
              God is also a better explanation than matter because God, being a supernatural being, has qualities which justify his inconceivable power to self-manifest and to be eternal. Matter on the other hand being inert and mindlessly subject to the laws of physics provides us with no reason to believe it is capable of generating its own existence.

                1.1.1.5.9.4.2.1.1. Con:
                The simplest matter, particles & the hydrogen atom didn't create themselves. They're organized energy. The force of gravity made the heavier elements inside stars. Some are inert, and some are very reactive.

          1.1.1.5.9.5. Con:
          This principle is too restrictive. It requires one not infer that God exists even if God does, in fact, exist and were putting forth every display of miracle to evidence that God exists.

            1.1.1.5.9.5.1. Con:
            The idea that scientific explanations eliminates God as the source implies that all God's work is inexplicable.

          1.1.1.5.9.6. Con:
          To accept this principle is to admit that one's lack of belief in God does not need to be based on a consideration of evidence. Instead, it implies one does not need to look at the evidence because, in principle, there can be no observation for which God is the best explanation.

            1.1.1.5.9.6.1. Con:
            Lack of belief derives directly from lack of sufficient evidence to make it appear likely to be true. Many atheists are former believers who came to the conclusion that the evidence does not justify belief.

              1.1.1.5.9.6.1.1. Con:
              To hold there is a lack of sufficient evidence for God implies one believes it is possible for there to be such evidence (i.e. observations for which inferring God as an explanation is not god-of-the-gaps reasoning). Therefore, one cannot hold to this and the initial principle that all inferences to God from observation are god-of-the-gaps reasoning.

            1.1.1.5.9.6.2. Con:
            Accepting Gödel's theorem is to accept the limitations of our knowledge, not our belief. Our belief can be founded on facts, mathematics, and beauty, as well as on provable evidence. Any proof that it is wrong, would invalidate our belief, but some beliefs, according to Gödel, are just that unverifiable.

          1.1.1.5.9.7. Con:
          Scientists a priori rejecti supernatural causes. Thus, scientists can be said to commit the naturalistic-theory-of-the-gaps fallacy, as they assume that there will be a future natural explanation for perplexing phenomena.

            1.1.1.5.9.7.1. Con:
            Scientific advancements continue to replace supernatural explanations with natural ones, while not even one supernatural explanation has unseated a scientific cause. Thus, belief in yet-to-be-discovered natural explanations is justified.

          1.1.1.5.9.8. Con:
          It's possible for God to be the best possible explanation for observational data and if such data were present then to deduce God as a hypothesis would not be pasting a hole in science with God but rather arriving at God via a scientific method.

            1.1.1.5.9.8.1. Con:
            The ancient Greeks and Romans had Gods to explain many natural events they observed. Those Gods have been replaced by science.

              1.1.1.5.9.8.1.1. Con:
              Science has made an egregious philosophical error in claiming to have proven these Gods don't exist. There is nothing about understanding the physics of how the sky is blue that proves It's not an artistic choice on the part of God. Similarly there is nothing about understanding meteorology that proves there isn't an entity controlling these mechanisms.

    1.1.2. Pro:
    Those best equipped to answer the question of whether a God exists, namely, scientists, do not believe a God exists.

      1.1.2.1. Pro:
      Only a minority of surveyed scientists [148] (33%) believe in a God.

        1.1.2.1.1. Con:
        The study only included members of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), meaning that the results likely do not represent the population of scientists outside of that organization.

          1.1.2.1.1.1. Con:
          While this sample may not represent scientists generally, there is no a priori reason to think so. Lacking any good reason to think otherwise, the results may be taken as (provisionally) representative, or nearly so.

        1.1.2.1.2. Con:
        Saying a lot of smart people believe something doesn't make it true. There are smart people on both sides of the debate. Galileo, Issac Newton, Johannes Kepler, and Francis Collins are examples of smart people who believe in God. Saying all these smart people believe in God is not evidence of God (there are other better pieces of evidence). Likewise, saying 33% of scientists believe in God is not a valid argument against God.

          1.1.2.1.2.1. Con:
          That only a minority of scientists believe in God is not a valid deductive argument that God does not exist, but it's not being presented as one; it's evidence in an inductive argument.

          1.1.2.1.2.2. Con:
          Early scientists like Galileo, Newton or Kepler are bad examples of believing scientists, because the state of available evidence was different then; one could just as easily say they didn't believe in evolution and therefore there is real controversy [149] among scientists.

      1.1.2.2. Con:
      There is no associated set criteria for determining those best equipped to answer the question.

      1.1.2.3. Con:
      Since God is metaphysical, it is erroneous to consider scientists as “best equipped” to investigate the matter.

        1.1.2.3.1. Pro:
        Since god is considered absolutely metaphysical by definition, that is something non-material so non-perceivable and only in our minds, there is no kind of person or knowledge that is "best equipped" to dis/prove god's existence in the world.

          1.1.2.3.1.1. Con:
          This is a non sequitur; even if God not being material meant that material evidence was irrelevant to the question of whether God exists, that doesn't change whether there is an ordering of who is best or worst equipped to know whether God exists, only the position of those who deal in material evidence in the ordering.

          1.1.2.3.1.2. Con:
          If God is absolutely metaphysical, non-material, non-perceivable, and only in our minds, then He cannot be considered as "existing", and has no influence on the real world.

            1.1.2.3.1.2.1. Pro:
            These characteristics can also describe a fictional being in a story, a dream character, an invention to make children behave, an "ideal being" used as an example by a dictatorship to control the population.

        1.1.2.3.2. Pro:
        Theologians (scholars of religion) are the best equipped to investigate the existence of God, leading other specialties on the subject.

          1.1.2.3.2.1. Pro:
          Leaving out the relevantly best equipped specialists equates to committing the fallacy of omission.

          1.1.2.3.2.2. Con:
          This is analogous to expecting cryptozoologists [150] to be best equipped to answer the question of the existence of Bigfoot. Those who dedicate their lives to the study of beings whose very existence is debated, will tend to be committed partisans of the camp that says they exist.

        1.1.2.3.3. Pro:
        Since there aren't any experiments following the scientific method on the methaphysical level, there's never to be evidence about God's existance, thus making it impossible to prove.

        1.1.2.3.4. Con:
        A metaphysical God that has no interaction with existence is akin to no God existing. If God interacts with existence then science should be able to examine that interaction.

      1.1.2.4. Con:
      To say that scientists are the best equipped to answer the question is to make a non-sequitur.

        1.1.2.4.1. Pro:
        Religious folk espousing religious claims often refer to science and philosophy as peripheral concerns, and focus on miracles, scripture, and textual analysis instead.

      1.1.2.5. Con:
      Some of the earliest and greatest scientists [151] pursued their work because they believed that the universe was created by a rational mind, and could be interpreted by a rational mind.

        1.1.2.5.1. Con:
        Due to the cumulative nature of scientific progress, the earliest scientists are almost by definition the least knowledgeable. Thus, we have a connection between scientists coming to better understand the world, and becoming atheists.

        1.1.2.5.2. Con:
        Einstein [152], the first referenced scientist in the above source, repeatedly stated that he was agnostic and did not believe in the Abrahamic God [153].

        1.1.2.5.3. Con:

          Many, such as Antony Flew, were convinced by scientific evidence such as the fine-tuning of the universe for life.

            1.1.2.5.3.1.1. Con:
            To believe that universe is fine-tuned for life is a fallacy we commit as beings which exist in this universe.

              1.1.2.5.3.1.1.1. Pro:
              What we see as fine-tuned is the only possible state for the universe to exist in a way that would lead to this very moment. It is not that Earth has miraculously been given atmosphere containing oxygen that we, conveniently, use to survive. We use oxygen because that's what we evolved to breathe because of how the universe turned out to be.

          1.1.2.5.3.2. Pro:
          The scientists did not provide a valid scientific work proving the existence of God. I.e. a work with, at least, hypotheses, methods and results that respect scientific criteria of reproducibility and refutability.

          1.1.2.5.3.3. Con:
          Many scientists became convinced of God's existence due to the the complexity, sophistication and intracacy they learned of from science.

        1.1.2.5.4. Con:
        Appealling to intelligent individuals as an argument is a logical fallacy known as an appeal to authority [154].

          1.1.2.5.4.1. Con:
          Saying that an argument is valid because an intelligent individual makes it is a logical fallacy. Citing an argument made by an intelligent individual is not.

        1.1.2.5.5. Con:
        There are also quite a few great minds [155] that are or were atheists.

    1.1.3. Con:
    There is no way to prove the absence of one thing from the list of all things [156]. Instead, the best science can provide in the way of evidence is an absence of positive evidence for God.

      1.1.3.1. Con:
      There is no way to prove existence of the list of all things. Therefore trying to define something as absence from such list doesn't make sense.

      1.1.3.2. Con:
      Reasoning using evidence, in general, is a matter of inductive reasoning [157], not deductive. It is confused to attribute a syllogistic fallacy to an inductive argument.

      1.1.3.3. Con:
      Absence of a thing is presumed unless sufficient evidence is presented to confirm its existence. Until such evidence is provided a claim is only presumed to be possible, at best, not true.

        1.1.3.3.1. Pro:
        If one presumes things exist without good evidence, a polytheistic set of gods, no gods or a monotheistic god that does not meet the constraints of classical theism are all equally as likely, thereby drastically reducing the likelihood of the specific god exists.

        1.1.3.3.2. Con:
        Existence or Non-Existence of some artifact is largely based on presuppositions. As such the default position should be agnosticism, not absence.

    1.1.4. Pro:
    If God was real, the earth and sun would be the only objects in the whole universe. All the other stars and planets wouldn't matter, since he would only care about the humans in earth. Since we observe other planets, we can infer that God is not real.

      1.1.4.1. Con:
      This is blatantly false; in the Bible, we read clearly that God created the stars and other celestial bodies beyond the earth in multiple places such as where it says He counts the stars and knows them all by name. The Bible describes in great detail the creation of the universe in its entirety.

    1.1.5. Con:
    There are scientific hypotheses for the existence of a creator of our world: simulated reality [158] theories and universe-in-a-lab [159] theories.

      1.1.5.1. Con:
      Such potential creators fail to meet the requirements of the god of classical theism, as the potential agents of construction of such simulations and labs cannot be qualified as omnipotent, omniscient or omnibenevolent.

        1.1.5.1.1. Pro:
        Religions and religious texts such as the Bible have not described their God using explanations with anything resembling a simulated reality (or similar), which appear to be concepts produced by science and philosophy.

          1.1.5.1.1.1. Pro:
          If such gods are clearly described as such, then they do not qualify as a god of classical theism [160] which has been defined at the root of this discussion.

            1.1.5.1.1.1.1. Con:
            To some or many, the distinction is not clear or blurry. Often, people use the term God outside of more narrow and accurate definitions. While the term is unfit, some use it regardless or use broader descriptions such as "religious notion of a creator [161]" or "godlike being [162]" with the context of [163] such hypotheses, including in [164] fiction [165]. The lack of specificity as to what exactly religions refer or don't refer to with the term God could be a major issue.

          1.1.5.1.1.2. Pro:
          Several bible verses [166] describe God this way and could easily be interpreted as such.

      1.1.5.2. Con:
      While possible, it is a dead end in terms of debate and rationality as if true, there would be no conceivable means to perceive yet alone escape such a simulation and thus its "subjects" would need to operate based on their perceived sensory input anyways and would not be justified in belief unless backed by evidence.

        1.1.5.2.1. Pro:
        There are no hints that point to these hypotheses and hence they should not be assumed to be true. Any potential hints may just as well point to a multitude of multiverse hypotheses, mathematical universe hypotheses, holographic universe hypotheses, and so on.

        1.1.5.2.2. Con:
        Some scientists and philosophers consider ideas of simulated reality, the holographic principle and so on as not unlikely [167] and there are ideas for experimentally [168] investigating [169] associated hypotheses. In late 2022 [170], a list of potential tests [171] may inspire further thought on potential tests.

          1.1.5.2.2.1. Pro:
          There are also hypothetical observational hints [172] but these are unlikely to not also have other explanations.

            1.1.5.2.2.1.1. Con:
            The phenomena of "spooky" action at a distance [173] may be one hint because [174] it seems as if effects can't travel faster than light but still things are connected in ways (quantum nonlocality [175]) that would then suggest nonrealism [176] that points toward a simulation or possibly simulation-related superdeterminism [177].

              1.1.5.2.2.1.1.1. Con:
              This is just an unresolved problem of current physics and an open question that confounds scientists, but is not hinting at this world being a simulation or similar in specific.

          1.1.5.2.2.2. Con:
          There are remarks these experiments would be likely boring (and a waste of effort) and without any valuable results, or extremely dangerous [178]. The experiments proposed are not necessarily likely to find evidence even if a 'simulation' or something similar is an sufficiently accurate description of the universe.

      1.1.5.3. Pro:
      What could also be considered to be part of such hypotheses are a) creative entities that live/d in a parallel universe of a multiverse created our universe to 'grow' parallel to theirs or b) created another 'dimension' or similar which could be considered to be our world; c) creative entities that lived in previous universe set up conditions for the subsequent ones in Big Bounce [179]-type scenarios; and d) similar science-based hypotheses.

        1.1.5.3.1. Con:
        While such could be part of such hypotheses, this is not what the God(s) of religions refers to or could refer to. Religions and religious people do not debate, think about, write, or hypothesize such things. These are not religious ideas but philosophical and/or scientific ones. Due to these and other reasons, they can't be what the term "God" refers to.

        1.1.5.3.2. Pro:
        There are no hints that point to any of these things. Big Bounce scenarios, for example, would not require beings to interfere to have impacts on the future and if they are able and do have a fingerprint on the subsequent universe(s), it's unlikely to be in a way that could be accurately described as act(s) of "creation".

        1.1.5.3.3. Pro:
        None of the artificial involvements appear to be necessary or constructive in terms of explaining physics or cosmology (or open questions and issues thereof).

      1.1.5.4. Con:
      Such creators are not gods, as they are not supernatural beings, which is part of the definition of a god [180].

        1.1.5.4.1. Pro:
        Insofar as a hypothesis about a simulator or other creator in "the next universe up" is scientific, it is describing a natural being without supernatural qualities.

        1.1.5.4.2. Con:
        If they do live in a parallel or superordinate world, that may fit the term or concept of a god for some believers, including a minority of theists if prompted since they would live in a nature that is beyond [181] our nature, where for example laws of physics may differ (e.g. different values of physical constants or a world that is more real instead of simulated).

          1.1.5.4.2.1. Con:
          That is still not what is meant with the term God, which is clear by a) descriptions of religious scriptures and doctrines b) the positions of the majorities and respective religious authorities of theists.

    1.1.6. Con:
    There are many accomplished, respected, knowledgeable scientists and philosophers at the top of their fields who are theists and/or Christians.

      1.1.6.1. Con:
      Most academic philosophers [182] (69.7%) don't believe a God exists.

        1.1.6.1.1. Con:
        The study sample was too small to be representative. There are ~4.5M people in the US with a Philosophy [183] Doctorate and fewer than 1M full-time postsecondary education faculty [184].

        1.1.6.1.2. Pro:
        For a sample size of around 4.5 million, with a confidence level of 95% and a margin of error of 2%, the sample size needs to be at least 2400 [185]. The sample size for the poll was over 3000. Thus, the results are significant.

        1.1.6.1.3. Con:
        As Quentin Smith argues [186], the fact that a majority of philosophers are non-theists is not to say that this majority holds good reasons for their view.

          1.1.6.1.3.1. Con:
          It is unlikely that the majority of philosophers, who have dedicated their careers to answering this question, have come to an erroneous conclusion.

        1.1.6.1.4. Con:
        This could be due to social conformity.

          1.1.6.1.4.1. Con:
          Religious people make up the majority [187] of the global population, and of the population of most countries. Social conformity alone could not drive the majority of philosophers to believe the opposite of what the majority of their neighbours believe.

          1.1.6.1.4.2. Pro:
          Most academics in general tend [188] to be socially progressive, and socially progressive people are less likely [189] to believe in the existence of God. This environment likely encourages academic philosophers to outwardly express atheistic views.

      1.1.6.2. Con:
      -> See 1.1.2.1.

      1.1.6.3. Con:
      This is basically an argument from collective authority [190] and does not refute that available scientific evidence strongly supports the non-existence of God as that term is defined throughout history and in the present. Scientists are not aware of all the existing evidence and often do not seek or consider it. If anything, more meaningful would be survey results about views or conclusions of such scientists only after they are made aware of and considered in-depth this scientific evidence.

    1.1.7. Pro:
    Scientific and historical observation appears to indicate that religion is a human construction, and all claims to the existence of God are religious in nature.

      1.1.7.1. Pro:
      Observation shows religions evolving and changing based on social norms, and borrowing rules, stories and customs from other sects, indicating a lack of divine origin.

        1.1.7.1.1. Pro:
        Christianity is derived from Judaism, given the textual source for the Old Testament is the Tanakh.

        1.1.7.1.2. Pro:
        Islam acknowledges [191] that Jesus was a prophet of god, but not the messiah or the son of god.

        1.1.7.1.3. Pro:
        A large number of myths from the Bible directly parallel other religions. [192]

        1.1.7.1.4. Pro:
        The birth of Jesus [193] is likely to have occurred between September and October. However, Christianity adopted the celebration of Christmas [194] from various [195] Roman [196] and Pagan [197] celebrations.

      1.1.7.2. Pro:
      Archeological evidence shows religions have independent origins [198] from each other, separated by vast geographic distances. The fact they don't align with each other is indicative that religion is a result of social behavior and supernatural entities (such as a god) aren't actually involved in the world.

        1.1.7.2.1. Pro:
        A majority of god claims assert that god (or a set of gods) desire worship, possess great supernatural power and seek the conversion of others. It does not follow that such a god (or gods) would restrict themselves to predominantly one geographic locale of origin and not be uniform on a global scale, particularly in areas inaccessible by early civilizations.

        1.1.7.2.2. Pro:
        There is evidence of religion having evolutionary origins [199] based upon anthropology [200] and evolutionary psychology [201].

      1.1.7.3. Pro:
      Various forms of mental illness have a tangible effect of the religiosity of people, implying the practice of religion is a form of human behavior.

        1.1.7.3.1. Pro:
        It is well documented that abused children who develop Dissociative Identity Disorder [202] (formerly known by the outdated term Multiple Personality Disorder) develop alters [203] that are non-human [204] based on childhood influences.

        1.1.7.3.2. Pro:
        Several mental conditions such as Schizophrenia [205], Bipolar Disorder [206], Geschwind Syndrome [207] and FTLD [208] often carry with them religious delusions [209] and hypereligiousity [210] as symptoms.

        1.1.7.3.3. Pro:
        People who suffer from Autism [211] demonstrate a reduced belief in god and religious belief [212]

      1.1.7.4. Pro:
      A large number of religious claims have been scientifically debunked as having natural causes or as being historically inaccurate. This reduces the credibility of the claims of the religion as a whole, and thus its specific god claim as well.

        1.1.7.4.1. Pro:
        Earthquakes [213] and lightning [214] are natural phenomena. They occur without any apparent form of divine intervention.

        1.1.7.4.2. Pro:
        The story of Noah's Ark is both physically impossible [215] and did not occur, given we have evidence of floods, much smaller then a global flood, and there is no evidence for a global flood [216] as one would expect to find if the story was accurate.

        1.1.7.4.3. Pro:
        Several separate written languages [217] existed before the founding of Babylon [218], some with separate independent origins, thus disproving the story of the Tower of Babel [219].

        1.1.7.4.4. Pro:
        Several religions have varying creation myths [220], of which none adequately align to current scientific consensus concerning the creation of the universe, or even the earth itself and seldom align with each other.

        1.1.7.4.5. Pro:
        -> See discussion #14445: There is no historical evidence of Exodus happening.

        1.1.7.4.6. Pro:
        Archeological evidence indicates that the Walls of Jericho were destroyed during a well documented Egyptian Campaign between 1700-1600BCE [221] and consensus amongst amongst scholars is that the Book of Joshua holds little historical value. [222]

        1.1.7.4.7. Pro:
        The Genesis creation myth [223] of Judaism, Christianity [224] and Islam [225] suffers from several scientific impossibilities and inaccuracies.

        1.1.7.4.8. Pro:
        Young Earth Creationism [226] which several Christian scholars over centuries have espoused as, states the earth having an age of 4-10 thousand years. This has been proven as incorrect [227] by multiple scientific disciplines.

          1.1.7.4.8.1. Pro:
          -> See discussion #10278: The earth cannot be under 10,000 years old.

      1.1.7.5. Con:
      Aristotelian and Thomistic philosophy use reasoning and the study of the natural world to make a claim of a “Prime Mover” also called “First Cause”. This is not a claim based on religious principles, or theological interpretation of texts said to be “sacred”.

        1.1.7.5.1. Con:
        Neither a first cause, nor a prime mover say anything of the god of classical theism as there is no commentary as to such a claim's omnipotence, omniscience, morality or even the involvement of potential agency required.

          1.1.7.5.1.1. Pro:
          The "First Cause" could simply be that a big bang is inherent to broader cosmology.

          1.1.7.5.1.2. Pro:
          The creation of the universe does not require any of the three above attributes. Thus a sufficiently advanced being could substitute for a god in this scenario.

      1.1.7.6. Pro:
      The evolutionary psychology of religion [228] appears to indicate the practice of religion is a form of social behavior.

      1.1.7.7. Con:
      Religious thinking is not just a human construction but an outcome of neuroevolution or ingrained in Homo sapiens neurology. Evolutionary psychology of religion [229], along with the prevalence of religious thinking or religions, indicate religion is a natural common outcome of human biology more broadly and group-level evolution [230].

        1.1.7.7.1. Pro:
        That humans evolved to commonly believe in God around the world indicates this it's not just a human construction or that this construction has underlying, i.e. psychobiological, origins.

        1.1.7.7.2. Con:
        If so this is an admission that religion is simply a consequence of biology, and a god is not involved in its creation.

        1.1.7.7.3. Con:
        It makes no sense for a god capable of ingraining religious behavior to not ingrain specific religious behavior.

      1.1.7.8. Con:
      This commits the genetic fallacy [231], trying to discredit something because of how someone came to believe it.

        1.1.7.8.1. Con:
        Whether a hypothesis was brought into consideration without good reason is relevant to how much consideration the hypothesis should be afforded; this is only fallacious if viewing the inductive argument through the lens of deductive logic.

        1.1.7.8.2. Con:
        When a core justification for belief is that it is of divine origin (as is the case for god), observation and evidence that said origin is mundane, detracts from it's believably.

      1.1.7.9. Con:
      This assumes that proof of, or belief in God, cannot be arrived at through non-religious means such as philosophy.

    1.1.8. Pro:
    Scientific evidence shows that on Earth, humanity has multiple [232], often quite different or contradicting, religions and views about God as well as a substantial population of atheists. If there was an omnipotent God, one would expect there to be only one large religion. This implies that either a) God is not omnipotent or interested in what humans do and believe in; or b) there are multiple gods (polytheism [233]); or c) no such God exists. Islam and Christianity have nearly the same share of believers.

      1.1.8.1. Con:
      God purportedly values free will, so mankind’s devotion or lack thereof does not imply anything about God’s existence or lack thereof.

        1.1.8.1.1. Con:
        In practice though people technically have free will, organised religion operates under the premise and MO that your eternal future or lack thereof after you die is subject to doing as you’re told while you live. This makes a case that, once one believes, creates a choice that in practice is so one sided, eternity vs your finite lifetime, that free will is only for the extremely stupid.

        1.1.8.1.2. Con:
        This may be reasonable only if all humans had the same religion but then diverged, due to free will, to believe in other 'false' religions or to become irreligious. This is not the case and one's geographical location (e.g. host country) or one's parents' faith is the largest determinant of which religion is followed.

      1.1.8.2. Con:
      The old theory that the infidels from any one particular perspective that are worshiping another god or gods are mistaken is consistent with the existence of one real God.

        1.1.8.2.1. Con:
        In the face of the rise of secular government and the decline in religious power, religions have in some ways tried to stand together, sometimes claiming that in some manner their separate gods are different views of the same god.

          1.1.8.2.1.1. Con:
          Generally the religions are so separate and set in their ways that when pushed or asked directly [234] they will fall back upon division.

          1.1.8.2.1.2. Con:
          Such claims are not only rare and not part of the religious doctrines themselves, but also not compatible with their religious doctrines which often claim that their God is the only true one and/or that their religious scriptures are completely accurate and/or the only true ones. Such claims would be invalid or inconsistent because these texts directly and indirectly contradict other religions, especially polytheistic ones.

        1.1.8.2.2. Con:
        The issue is not that people are mistaken; it's that so many people would then be mistaken and that the factors for which religion or God is believed in seem to be rather of geographical and cultural/familial upbringing nature. There is not one large religion and a few minor small ones but multiple large ones quite comparable in their share of believers.

      1.1.8.3. Con:
      The 2 statements "Multiple religions exist" and "God is omnipotent" are not contradictory; there must be hidden assumptions to come to that conclusion, not to mention many religions say their gods allow you to be free moral agents, such as Christianity. And many religions don't believe that their god will force you.

    1.1.9. Pro:
    The existence of God is based on metaphysics, which cannot be proved, and there is no logical need for it to exist. Therefore, God's existence is illogical.

    1.1.10. Con:
    Empirical evidence cannot prove the existence or non-existence of God.

      1.1.10.1. Con:
      Representationalism [235] is false. It is not possible for words to faithfully "mirror" the real world; thus, it's not necessary for the belief in God to mirror reality in order for those beliefs to be true.

      1.1.10.2. Con:
      A valid hypothesis must accurately describe and predict all available data. The hypothesis "there is no god" accurately fits all of the available data, whereas "God exists" does not fit all of the available data.

        1.1.10.2.1. Con:
        The conclusion "God exists" does not obviously conflict with any available data. The arguments to the contrary are primarily arguments of why we should not accept it, rather than claims that it could not be true.

          1.1.10.2.1.1. Con:
          "God exists" is not a falsifiable hypothesis, and therefore not viable to proper research. For a hypothesis to be falsifiable, there has to be a "if A were to be discovered, that would disprove the hypothesis". For the hypothesis that God doesn't exist, A could be for example an unadulterated video recording of God in his true (distinguishable from human) form. For the inverse hypothesis, there is no possible A where "if A is found, the hypothesis is disproven".

        1.1.10.2.2. Pro:
        In investigating a hypothesis, there is always a margin of error. In scientific research, this margin of error (most often 5%) is preset to determine when a result, until falsified, can be considered evidence. This means that even if you perform research in the most stringent of settings, you will have 5% false positives (i.e. falsehoods retained as evidence). So by that factor alone some evidence could virtually be found to support any  hypothesis, regardless of truth.

        1.1.10.2.3. Con:
        Relational claims contingent on the character of being are not subject to strict prediction testing. E.g. I might say "If John loves Mary, John will buy her flowers," but that is only a statement of probablility, and not subject to the same predictable requirements of natural science. The same is true with the predictions we have about a personal God.

          1.1.10.2.3.1. Con:
          The primary thesis of this discussion does not claim that the god in question is a "personal God".

        1.1.10.2.4. Con:
        The statement God doesn't exist gits the available data with a lot of mechanisms left unexplained and with major mathematical improbabilities.

          1.1.10.2.4.1. Con:
          Accepting God on these premises is a God of the gaps [236] fallacy.

        1.1.10.2.5. Con:
        The statement God exists has more explaining power than any other possible explanation. As it accounts for all the anomalies encountered and it explains consciousness and the metaphysical world of values and morals.

          1.1.10.2.5.1. Con:
          "The metaphysical world of values and morals" does not exist, and a theory that explains things that do not exist is correspondingly less likely to be true.

          1.1.10.2.5.2. Con:
          Just like "this is all a dream" or "I am insane", "God did it" can explain any possibility and consequently has zero explanatory power.

          1.1.10.2.5.3. Con:
          God explains no more than any other MacGuffin [237] answer and is not valuable in seeking truth.

      1.1.10.3. Con:
      Empirical evidence could trivially prove that God exists through the direct observation of God's actions such as miracles.

        1.1.10.3.1. Con:
        Even the direct observation of miracles would be inconclusive as proof of God's existence.

          1.1.10.3.1.1. Pro:
          Even the empirical observation of a genuine miracle could be naturalistically rationalized.

            1.1.10.3.1.1.1. Pro:
            Documented, medically inexplicable healing miracles could yet be rationalized as false diagnoses or intentional fabrications.

            1.1.10.3.1.1.2. Pro:
            Personal encounters of God in bodily form could be rationalized as hallucinations.

          1.1.10.3.1.2. Con:
          While truly conclusive proof for anything beyond "cogito ergo sum" is not really possible, sufficient miraculous evidence could make the existence of God as empirically-supported as, say, the theory of gravity, or the idea that the Earth is round.

        1.1.10.3.2. Pro:
        There is an abundance of documented miracle claims [238] that resist naturalistic explanation.

          1.1.10.3.2.1. Pro:
          Supernatural explanations have unseated scientific ones in the cases of Eucharistic miracles [239].

            1.1.10.3.2.1.1. Con:
            There were no theories about miracles to overthrow.

            1.1.10.3.2.1.2. Pro:
            The Miracle of Lanciano [240] has scientific support. The physician who examined the Eucharist confirmed that the contents were cardiac tissue and fresh blood.

          1.1.10.3.2.2. Con:
          The article states, "the vast majority of these miracles occur in the third world and lack medical and scientific documentation." This is a natural explanation [241].

            1.1.10.3.2.2.1. Con:
            Since the medically documented reports from western countries were treated not as a statistical sample but rather as case studies, survivorship bias does not apply.

          1.1.10.3.2.3. Con:
          As demonstrated by the placebo effect [242], behavior change can occur simply because a person has faith in the process. Therefore, a change in behavior is not evidence of the legitimacy of an intervention, divine or otherwise.

            1.1.10.3.2.3.1. Pro:
            The placebo effect [243] is so powerful that it can even cure diseases. Thus, much of what are regarded as miracles may merely be attributable to the placebo effect.

              1.1.10.3.2.3.1.1. Con:
              Our bodies could have been purposefully designed by God to have complex neurological reactions to cure diseases and heal the body.

              1.1.10.3.2.3.1.2. Pro:
              If our body is constructed in such way that enables it to heal in response to some placebo treatment, then remarkable recovery is not necessarily caused by a miracle; it might just be how our bodies work.

            1.1.10.3.2.3.2. Pro:
            Placebos are so powerful that they can alleviate the symptoms of conditions like irritable bowel syndrome [244], even if the affected person is aware that the pill is a placebo.

          1.1.10.3.2.4. Con:
          When a miracle is by our current understanding of the world impossible and illogical, there needs to be a crushing evidence to accept that miracle as real.

          1.1.10.3.2.5. Pro:
          A miracle [245] is, by definition, inexplicable by any naturalistic means; otherwise, we would simply accept it as a natural event.

            1.1.10.3.2.5.1. Pro:
            A miracle that does defy the rules of the natural world (for example feeding 5000 people with 5 loaves and 2 fish) is impossible in this universe.

              1.1.10.3.2.5.1.1. Con:
              The natural order and laws of physics are based on experience and observations, and as such any observation that appears to violate them should be investigated and our understanding of the world adjusted to match, rather than simply denying unexpected results as impossible.

                1.1.10.3.2.5.1.1.1. Con:
                The current observation is that such a miracle is impossible and, while any miracle claims are being investigated, the matter should be seen in this way.

                1.1.10.3.2.5.1.1.2. Con:
                The claim is true, in the sense that this is exactly what happens when we: i) observe something happening which is supposed not to happen, and ii) independent sources duplicate and re-affirm the result through experiment or scientifically controlled, i.e. precisely measured, observation. This unfortunately means that all biblical mentions of miracles are, by default, non-scientific, and basically a multi-corroborated hearsay, coming from an non-scientific age with minimal deciphering abilities.

              1.1.10.3.2.5.1.2. Con:
              Interference by an external omnipotent force could account for such miracles by inserting extra matter/energy, in the same way that the energy of someone removing a billiards ball wasn't accounted for originally. Such an act of interference is certainly logically possible.

        Miraculous healing serves as evidence for the existence of God.

          Barbara Snyder's [246] rapid and mysterious full recovery from multiple sclerosis following a Christian radio show's appeal for prayer on her behalf is a striking example of miraculous healing.

          1.1.10.3.3.2. Pro:
          Sharyn Mackay [247] of Newcastle's recovery from cancer suggests miraculous intervention.

          1.1.10.3.3.3. Con:
          Lourdes is regarded as a sanctified site for many Catholics where miraculous healing would appear, but in fact, there are no more cancer healings [248] in this site than there are spontaneous unexplained cancer healing in any other place.

      1.1.10.4. Pro:
      Science is the study of the natural world, but God is a supernatural entity. Therefore, science cannot prove or disprove the existence of God.

        1.1.10.4.1. Con:
        If God has any influence on the real world, then these manifestations should be observable (in a broad term, not restricted to vision), and therefore be the subject of a scientific process.

          1.1.10.4.1.1. Pro:
          If God does not have any influence on the real world, then it 'corresponds to deist conceptions of God [249]. It is impossible to prove that they do not exist.

          1.1.10.4.1.2. Con:
          There are occurrences in the real world that are God's influence. However, using scientific process on God's influence would always result in a scientific outcome (an explanation without God) or no outcome at all.

        1.1.10.4.2. Con:
        There aren't good reasons to presume the supernatural exists.

          1.1.10.4.2.1. Pro:
          Empirical studies of the complex processes of nature indicate that the natural world can be understood without appealing to divine creation.

            Stephen Meyer [250] - an American advocate of the principle of intelligent design - has presented [251] evidence for intelligent design.

              1.1.10.4.2.1.1.1. Pro:
              He showed in "Darwin's Doubt [252]" how the fossil record poses great problems for the theory of evolution.

              1.1.10.4.2.1.1.2. Pro:
              He formulated an argument for Intelligent Design based on the digital information contained inside DNA which follows the same method of argument as Darwin used to establish evolution and which is immune to the God of the Gaps accusation.

                1.1.10.4.2.1.1.2.1. Pro:
                There are no known causes to explain 'the complex specified digital information found in DNA'. There are only hypothetical explanations, and more than one of those.

                  1.1.10.4.2.1.1.2.1.1. Con:
                  A mind is the only explanation backed up by observation. Minds have been observed creating information, natural processes have not.

                    1.1.10.4.2.1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro:
                    Genetic mutations occur by breaking information not by creating it.

                      1.1.10.4.2.1.1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro:
                      Genetic mutations come at a cost [253] because they break information.

                1.1.10.4.2.1.1.2.2. Con:
                DNA is a way for cells to replicate their attributes for the next generation. It occurs by natural mechanisms (observed and studied), does not requires any God, and is not proof of intelligent design.

            1.1.10.4.2.1.2. Pro:
            Phylogenetics [254] indicates [255] that evolution, not creation, is responsible for the diversity of life.

              1.1.10.4.2.1.2.1. Con:
              The phylogenetic tree is a product of circular reasoning. The theory of descent with common ancestry is used to structure the data and the structure produced is given as evidence for the theory.

                1.1.10.4.2.1.2.1.1. Pro:
                The fossil record shows discrete organisms with a stark absence of intermediaries. The story this tells does not indicate common ancestry as the links the theory invokes are not present.

                  1.1.10.4.2.1.2.1.1.1. Pro:
                  Punctuated equilibrium was proposed as an attempt to rationalise this lack of intermediaries, but it fails as a solution because sudden dramatic changes are mathematically implausibe with the current understanding of the mutation selection mechanism.

            1.1.10.4.2.1.3. Pro:
            That organisms carry evidence [256] of common ancestry indicates that evolution, not creation, is responsible for the diversity of life.

            1.1.10.4.2.1.4. Pro:
            Evolutionary opportunism [257] indicates that evolution, not creation, is responsible for the diversity of life.

            1.1.10.4.2.1.5. Pro:
            Molecular sequence evidence [258] indicates that evolution, not creation, is responsible for the diversity of life.

              1.1.10.4.2.1.5.1. Con:
              Genetic similarities between species are also consistent with design as designers are known to use the same blue print and make variations on it.

                1.1.10.4.2.1.5.1.1. Pro:
                A variety of cars from the same manufacturer may share the same engine and chassis.

                1.1.10.4.2.1.5.1.2. Con:
                A single designer may use similar blueprints, or may experiment with wildly different designs each time. As such, design as a hypothesis makes no predictions in this area, while evolution specifically predicts the genetic similarity that we in fact see, so by Bayes' rule the genetic similarity of life better supports common descent than a common designer.

                  1.1.10.4.2.1.5.1.2.1. Con:
                  The liklihood of these similaraities is no greater in the case of evolution than it is if intelligent design is the case. In fact similaraties in design are practically uniquiteous.

            1.1.10.4.2.1.6. Pro:
            Observed changes [259] in living things indicate that evolution, not creation, is responsible for the diversity of life.

              1.1.10.4.2.1.6.1. Con:
              The observed changes show minor variations within existing species and not major innovations in body plans and functions.

                1.1.10.4.2.1.6.1.1. Con:
                Speciation has been observed [260]; we are not just talking about changes within species.

                  1.1.10.4.2.1.6.1.1.1. Con:
                  While this demonstrates a variation resulting in an inability of the new variant to bred with its relatives, it does not demonstrate major innovation in body plan and function. It merely satisfies a technical definition of species.

                    1.1.10.4.2.1.6.1.1.1.1. Pro:
                    The definition of species as 1 unable to breed with its relatives may serve a purpose, but it does not serve to define genetic variations significant enough to demonstrate that the mutation selection mechanism is capable of producing novel body plans and major innovations in function.

                    1.1.10.4.2.1.6.1.1.1.2. Pro:
                    To generate new body plans it must be done at the level of dGRNs, which are gene regulatory networks responsible for the embryological development of orgisms. Mutations to these genes are always catastrophic [261] making major innovation impossible.

                      1.1.10.4.2.1.6.1.1.1.2.1. Pro:
                      Mutations to genes that don't effect embryological development may produce organisms which can survive and reproduce, but they are unable to generate novel body plans.

                        1.1.10.4.2.1.6.1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro:
                        "There is always an observable consequence if a dGRN subcircuit is interrupted. Since these consequences are always catastrophically bad, flexibility is minimal, and since the subcircuits are all interconnected, the whole network partakes of the quality that there is only one way for things to work. And indeed the embryos of each species develop in only one way." - Eric Davidson

                1.1.10.4.2.1.6.1.2. Con:
                Seeing "major innovations in body plans and functions" on human timescales would contradict the theory of evolution as we understand it. That we do not see evidence that would refute the theory of evolution is not much of an argument against the theory of evolution.

                  1.1.10.4.2.1.6.1.2.1. Con:
                  The fossil record doesn't show evidence gradual changes in form and function leading to big changes as outlined in "Darwin's Doubt". The theory punctuated equilibrium was advanced in an attempt to rationalise this fact.

          1.1.10.4.2.2. Pro:
          The supernatural has no explanatory power and inhibits the investigation of natural causes. We could ascribe anything unknown to supernatural causes which is what people did in the earlier days when the scientific method was not as popular.

            1.1.10.4.2.2.1. Con:
            Not all hypotheses that can explain anything unknown (and thus have no explanatory power) are supernatural, and not all supernatural hypotheses have this property.

              1.1.10.4.2.2.1.1. Pro:
              "We live in a computer simulation" is a naturalistic hypothesis which can nevertheless be used to explain any otherwise inexplicable event, and thus used has no explanatory power.

              1.1.10.4.2.2.1.2. Pro:
              If you see a swarm of bats coalesce into an unnaturally pale man with elongated canines, "that guy's a vampire" is a supernatural hypothesis with explanatory power.

          1.1.10.4.2.4. Pro:
          If one is to accept supernatural claims, then one must equally accept the supernatural claims of other non-monotheistic faiths, thereby weakening the case for a monotheistic god, specific or otherwise.

        1.1.10.4.3. Pro:
        Science merely describes natural phenomena, but it cannot explain why they occur. As such, science can never prove or disprove the existence of God.

          1.1.10.4.3.1. Con:
          Science suggests that how an event occurs is by way of thermodynamical processes, which is precisely the same as the reason why they occur i.e. because of thermodynamical processes

          1.1.10.4.3.2. Pro:
          Issac Newton [262] claims that while "gravity explains the motions of the planets, it cannot explain who sets the planets in motion.”

            1.1.10.4.3.2.1. Con:
            According to the Einstein's theory of relativity, [263] planets are in free fall in the gravitational field created by the other nearby objects when they move around the stars. So there is no need to have any entity that would set the planets in motion.

            1.1.10.4.3.2.2. Con:
            Asking "Who set the planets in motion?", or "Who caused the big bang?" begs the question and assumes without justification that there must be a prime mover.

              1.1.10.4.3.2.2.1. Pro:
              If the motion of planets can indeed be loosely attributed to a "person" as the cause, this does not provide an argument that the person responsibile is omniscient and omnipotent as they would have to be, to be described as a God.

        1.1.10.4.4. Con:
        Arguments for the existence of God are designed to show that the existence of God is more compatible with the evidence we have than the non-existence of God.

        1.1.10.4.5. Pro:
        Just as God's existence cannot be proven, he cannot be proven to not exist. Thus, the concept of God is a belief system which people can take or leave based on personal preference.

          1.1.10.4.5.1. Pro:
          If empiricism is not relevant to beliefs which accord with reality, one can believe anything and that belief should be held to the same regard as any other faith based belief.

          1.1.10.4.5.2. Pro:
          According to Protagoras, "Man is the measure of all things" and, therefore, "For those that believe god exists, he exists; for those that do not believe god exists, he does not exist." Subjectivity entails uncertainty and, therefore, no support can be given.

            1.1.10.4.5.2.1. Con:
            If subjectivity entails uncertainty, then no special support can be given to the mere human Protagoras, and the argument that we cannot support a notion from philosophy defeats itself.

          One cannot choose what to believe [264]. You believe or you do not, you cannot fake this mindset.

        1.1.10.4.6. Pro:
        The scientific community dismisses evidence supporting supernatural phenomena, such as the existence of God, due to rigid adherence to methodological naturalism.

          1.1.10.4.6.2. Con:
          While true, the claim in no way shows that it is improper to use the conclusions of scientific research as evidence for non-scientific conclusions. Nor is it improper to use certain non-scientific conclusions as scientific evidence.

            1.1.10.4.6.2.1. Con:
            Science can only test for natural causes; therefore, it is always assumed that there is a natural cause. Thus it would be a mistake to attempt to use science as evidence for the supernatural or non-scientific. This sort of thinking will result in circular reasoning, in which one cannot prove nor disprove the existence of God. And because belief in God is an ancient belief, the burden of proof is on those who claim there is no God.

            1.1.10.4.6.2.2. Pro:
            The "scientific method" is not derived from science. Indeed, it could not be, for that would mean that it existed before it was derived. Therefore, science itself is based on a philosophical, not a scientific foundation.

              1.1.10.4.6.2.2.1. Con:
              This statement is a fallacy of equivocation between science, a category of knowledge, and the scientific method, which is a means of testing explainatuons and predictions. Kialo is an example of the scientific method, but it deals in subjects not limited to science.

            If the story of the Exodus was accurate, we would expect to find signs of a substantial population decline as a result of the plagues of Egypt, but no such evidence has been found and all evidence points to consistent population growth over time. [265]

            1.1.10.4.6.3.2. Pro:
            If the story of Noah was accurate, we would expect to find a massive population bottleneck [266] as a result of somehow repopulating all species on earth with only a single pair of each animal, say nothing of the massive complications from inbreeding [267] as a result.

              1.1.10.4.6.3.2.1. Pro:
              We would not only find a massive population bottleneck but it would (likely) not be possible for these species to survive (without biotechnology) for long due [268] to [269] inbreeding [270] or [271] genetic diversity issues; they'd be dead species walking [272] (living for a while after the events but it being physically impossible for them to survive). There is a "minimum viable population [273]" and even if it is small, it is larger than two. This also refutes the Adam and Eve story.

            1.1.10.4.6.3.3. Con:

              If Athiests were interested in discovering God they might follow a process purported to reveal God to the practitioner similar to how people interested in acquiring wealth follow a process chalked out by others who have achieved wealth.

                Many atheists [274]/agnostics were once Christians who believed that something is good when it helps people rather than something being good because God likes it, so when they read the bible they realised God is evil [275] and therefore not deserving of worship, or have found holes in the story.

              Older cultures had a more primitive understanding of the natural world. Lack of knowledge, mental diseases, and corruption of oral histories could lead to misrepresentation of purely natural behaviour.

          1.1.10.4.6.4. Pro:
          The author of the book Forbidden Archeology [276] argues that fossil evidence is filtered out by the scientific community [277] when it challenges strongly held beliefs about materialism and evolution.

          1.1.10.4.6.5. Pro:
          Near-death experiences are evidence for consciousness existing separate from the body, but are dismissed without empirical consideration.

            1.1.10.4.6.5.1. Con:
            People having unusual conscious experiences when their bodies are in extreme situations follows naturally from consciousness being embodied.

            1.1.10.4.6.5.2. Con:
            Empirical studies have been performed [278] regarding near-death experiences [279] and out of body experiences near-death [280], and not a single case has yet to produce a result to indicate an actual out of body perception and do not appear to contradict known physiological models [281], most supported being such experiences are symptoms of Hypoxia [282].

            1.1.10.4.6.5.3. Con:
            What you see in a near-death experience, is influenced by your cultural background, including your religion [283].

              1.1.10.4.6.5.3.1. Con:
              Cultural background definitely shapes up the way the experience is presented, however, universal elements such as seeing deceased relatives, a supreme being, a white light tunnel do exist.

                1.1.10.4.6.5.3.1.1. Con:
                Seeing white light during near death experiences could be a biological phenomenon.

                  1.1.10.4.6.5.3.1.1.1. Pro:
                  The brain enters a state of high activity [284] before death. This may be a reason for why people see bright lights.

      1.1.10.5. Pro:
      We are physically unable to search everywhere for definite evidence of the non-existence of God due to our finite nature.

      1.1.10.6. Pro:
      The world is a very complicated place, and we perceive so little of it. We see only 3 dimensions, see only the 1 trillionth part of the light spectrum and we cant see past the observable universe. We will never know how immense the reality actually is! We know and perceive so little. Its impossible to know if a God exists, but would that be the case if we perceived the world as it is?

      1.1.10.7. Con:
      In science, you don't need to prove the non-existence of something; for something to be considered existent, empirical evidence must be given.

      1.1.10.8. Pro:
      Empirical evidence presupposes purely material phenomena, but God is immaterial. Therefore, there could never, even in principle, be a purely empirical proof of the existence of God.

        1.1.10.8.1. Pro:
        If God is pure actuality, then he cannot be material (physical), for matter always and necessarily contains an admixture of potentiality.

          1.1.10.8.1.1. Pro:
          In fact, traditional Aristotelian understanding of matter is that it is pure potentiality, but agreement with this idea is not necessary for the statement about God to be true.

        1.1.10.8.2. Con:
        Empirical proofs can be used if the immaterial entity interacts with a material entity. If a god is interacting with this world, we should be able to measure it with empirical methods.

          1.1.10.8.2.1. Con:
          The concept of divine intervention assumes that the world runs or could run by itself, but classical theism denies this, instead holding that God not only created everything, but sustains everything in being from moment to moment.

        1.1.10.8.3. Pro:
        The God claim and any possible proof of it is metaphysical therefore it may never be proven by experimentation, fixing it outside the knowable. This means that to believe in God one will always have to make a very large series of assumptions, which leaves the believer open to a wealth of inaccuracies. To not believe must be the default.

          1.1.10.8.3.1. Con:
          It is an error to presume that only that which is measurable can be shown to exist.

            1.1.10.8.3.1.1. Pro:
            The abstract number "1" exists. Yet, we cannot measure the number 1 itself. Thus, although we may not have a way to measure a god, it does not necessarily follow that there is no reason to believe a god exists.

              1.1.10.8.3.1.1.1. Con:
              1 is a measurement. It does not require measurement. God is not a measurement and therefore should be measurable.

                1.1.10.8.3.1.1.1.1. Pro:
                The concept of "1" is used to comprehend measurements. The concept exists. But the concept itself cannot be measured.

                1.1.10.8.3.1.1.1.2. Pro:
                Measurements are standardized. A god is not.

            1.1.10.8.3.1.2. Pro:
            Qualia [288] are another existing feature of reality that cannot be measured.

          1.1.10.8.3.2. Con:
          Metaphysical means neither "beyond experimentation" nor "outside the knowable". It means beyond sensual. Senses are the common platform on which science is founded. This only means that objectivity of metaphysical cannot be verified by senses. But in religion there are also experiments, knowledge and the sharing of knowledge. Difference is in spiritual knowledge being subjective and beyond senses. Not a series,but a single assumption on "where all this came from" or "what is my purpose" will do.

        1.1.10.8.4. Con:
        We do see the effects of God interacting with this world. For example, research shows that religion helps people better cope with life stresses [289]. If God exists, then interaction with Him would have an expected positive impact, like these [290] studies [291] show [292]. The problem is not "do we see evidence of God interacting", but "do we attribute what evidence we're seeing to God, or to some other causal mechanism."

      1.1.10.9. Pro:
      The existence or non-existence of God cannot be established through the scientific process.

        1.1.10.9.1. Con:
        Science is not the only source of human knowledge.

          1.1.10.9.1.1. Pro:
          Science is itself based on philosophical and mathematical reasoning.

          1.1.10.9.1.2. Con:
          Science is one way to structure and interpret information acquired through the senses. Knowledge can be accumulated from data that we collect, and we can use science to analyze the data. There are non-scientific methods of data analysis, but those methods have not been proven effective.

            1.1.10.9.1.2.1. Con:
            Presumably, the philosophical foundations of science have proven effective. It seems incorrect, therefore, to assume that philosophy can simply be dismissed as ineffective.

            1.1.10.9.1.2.2. Con:
            If this argument is to avoid circularity, it must first justify its means of proving a method effective. This seems fraught with difficulty over what should be considered proof, as well as what should be considered effective.

            1.1.10.9.1.2.3. Con:
            This scientific method can be applied to analysis of metaphysical phenomenon and subjective experiences felt by practitioners of a spiritual or religious processes. Such a pursuit would provide evidence for God.

              1.1.10.9.1.2.3.1. Pro:
              The claim nothing exists which cannot be empirically verified contradicts itself as it cannot be empirically verified its self. It is therefore self refuting.

                1.1.10.9.1.2.3.1.1. Pro:
                This is self refuting claim is used, generally unconsciously, to claim there is no metaphysical reality, no God or at minimum we can never know. It's essentially the unstated premise by which the philosophically erroneous claim that science proves God doesn't exist is based.

            1.1.10.9.1.2.4. Con:
            The claim science is the gatekeeper of knowledge is almost always tied in with the assumption that nothing exists which cannot be empirically verified.

              1.1.10.9.1.2.4.1. Pro:
              The statement nothing exists which cannot be empirically verified cannot be empirically verified and is therefore self refuting

          1.1.10.9.1.3. Pro:
          God can be known only by faith, which is a personal experience. Therefore, the existence of God cannot be proven to those without faith.

            1.1.10.9.1.3.1. Con:
            Proof of personal experiences are demonstrated in courts of justice to our peers using physical evidence that removes reasonable doubt.

              1.1.10.9.1.3.1.1. Pro:
              In events where an allegation of rape has been made, the parties involved may provide conflicting statements, and the alleged assailant may deny involvement. Physical evidence collected from the victim and the scene of the crime can prove/disprove the testimony of either party.

            1.1.10.9.1.3.2. Con:
            Faith based on personal experiences is not a reliable means of deriving truth.

              1.1.10.9.1.3.2.1. Pro:
              Using personal faith to support the existence of God is logically fallacious.

                1.1.10.9.1.3.2.1.1. Pro:
                This is also known as confirmation bias [293].

                1.1.10.9.1.3.2.1.2. Pro:
                There is a cart before the horse problem here. "One must believe that God exists," is being used to support the above claim that "supports the existence of God."

                  1.1.10.9.1.3.2.1.2.1. Con:
                  One must have sufficient faith to conduct an experiment before he can see the outcome, therefore faith does not invalidate the conclusions that required it. Formal proof uses this very pattern: "Assume XYZ. Then it would follow that..."

                    1.1.10.9.1.3.2.1.2.1.1. Con:
                    I could conduct an experiment because I believe you are 100% wrong and want to prove it, and then see the outcome.

              1.1.10.9.1.3.2.2. Pro:
              Faith is indistinguishable from a claim of faith. In other words, true faith and false faith both manifest as claims of faith. Therefore, faith claims cannot be used to justify belief over disbelief.

                1.1.10.9.1.3.2.2.1. Con:
                There is a correlation between true beliefs and survival-producing behaviors. Therefore, true beliefs are more likely to be selected for than false beliefs.

                  1.1.10.9.1.3.2.2.1.1. Pro:
                  Stephen Law [294] argues that "conceptual constraints" link survival-producing behaviors with true beliefs more strongly than with false beliefs.

                  1.1.10.9.1.3.2.2.1.2. Con:
                  This argument assumes a logical connection in the brain between beliefs and behaviors. Evolution has no reason to favor brains whose beliefs are logically connected to their behaviors. It only cares about the behaviors.

                    1.1.10.9.1.3.2.2.1.2.1. Pro:
                    A brain structure where seeing food when hungry triggers the true belief that eating is required to avoid starvation and the behavior of eating the food is no more likely to be selected for than a brain structure where seeing food when hungry triggers the false belief that trees are lizard people in disguise and the behavior of eating the food.

                      1.1.10.9.1.3.2.2.1.2.1.1. Con:
                      There is a true sense in which behaviors are caused by beliefs. My belief that my child is endangered (e.g. I hear it's frightened cry) causes me to try to protect it (I don't yet know what I need to do to protect it (maybe defend it, maybe heal it, maybe carry or lead it away: whatever is needed). As this is clearly highly selected for, it follows that we can expect beliefs and behaviors to be related, and not arbitrary.

                      1.1.10.9.1.3.2.2.1.2.1.2. Con:
                      Language (e.g. English) is a stimulus-belief-behavior relationship and process that cannot be implanted by evolution. As most people learn a language and communicate with others, it follows that beliefs and behaviors must be related in at least this case. As we have no reason to consider this a special or anomalous case, it follows that stimulus, belief, and behavior must be related.

                    1.1.10.9.1.3.2.2.1.2.2. Con:
                    Beliefs supervene on neurochemical brain states [295]. Neurochemical brain states cause behaviors. Thus, beliefs can be said to cause behaviors.

                1.1.10.9.1.3.2.2.3. Pro:
                Belief is subjective, and is not relevant to a discussion regarding the objective ontology of an entity (e.g. God).

                1.1.10.9.1.3.2.2.4. Pro:
                Belief in the existence of God can be, and often is, held with no justification in regards to the truth of that idea.

                1.1.10.9.1.3.2.2.5. Con:
                Belief does not require justification, as it is inherently subjective.

              1.1.10.9.1.3.2.3. Pro:
              Faith and belief are cognitive functions the holder possess because of the inability to explain super complex ideas and sensations beyond the mental maturity of the holder.

              Faith can be used to come to mutually exclusive conclusions.

                1.1.10.9.1.3.2.4.1. Pro:
                Incorrect things can be believed by faith. As such, it is not a form of empirical proof [296].

                  1.1.10.9.1.3.2.4.1.1. Con:
                  Incorrect things can be believed by empirical proof. This is the basis for almost all illusions, such as optical illusions.

            1.1.10.9.1.3.3. Con:
            It is possible to know that God exists without faith. Aristotle reasoned his way into an abstract understanding of the existence of God, despite having no reported personal experience of God.

            1.1.10.9.1.3.4. Pro:
            God communicates with those who wish to know him. Through this, one can know that God exists.

              1.1.10.9.1.3.4.1. Con:
              Subjective experiences are not reliable. When a person affirms that God is communicating with them, there is no way to verify if what they are saying is true.

              1.1.10.9.1.3.4.2. Pro:
              Jesus said [297] "my sheep hear my voice," so believers who hear Jesus' voice can confirm that Jesus exists.

                Hearers may not be able to accurately discern if the speaker is, in fact, Jesus Christ.

            1.1.10.9.1.3.5. Con:
            This is not an argument for the existence of God as much as it is an argument against reason and rational inquiry.

            1.1.10.9.1.3.6. Pro:
            God could have created world in such way that finding proof for his existence is impossible, to give us possibility of believing - not knowing for sure.

              1.1.10.9.1.3.6.1. Con:
              "Faith" originates from the Greek word "pistis [298]," which Aristotle defined as "forensic proof" when used as a noun and "trust based on evidence" when used as a verb. The public acts that Jesus performed serve as evidence for "pistis" in Christ.

              1.1.10.9.1.3.6.2. Pro:
              It is not possible to strictly prove existence of God on a rational level, but only on spiritual level of being. Spiritual being is in many ways contrary to the rational approach. The more we try to rationally prove God, the more we move away from spirituality and from God itself.

        Testable predictions have been developed to investigate the existence of God, but they have not yielded supporting evidence.

          1.1.10.9.3.1. Pro:
          God's existence could be tested through prayer. If one were to pray for something to happen, and what was prayed for happened, the observation of a prayer being answered would support the existence of God.

            1.1.10.9.3.1.1. Con:
            The classical definition of God does not require that God answer prayers.

            1.1.10.9.3.1.2. Pro:
            Prayer studies [299] are evidence that a God who intervenes to answer prayers [300] does not exist.

              1.1.10.9.3.1.2.1. Con:
              The participants may have prayed to a God who does not intervene, so the findings are not proof that God does not exist.

              1.1.10.9.3.1.2.2. Con:
              The study did not control control for prayers received from family and friends, so it is possible that such prayers received by the control participants influenced the findings.

              1.1.10.9.3.1.2.3. Con:
              There are well documented cases of scientifically inexplicable recoveries after prayer [301].

            1.1.10.9.3.1.3. Pro:
            One may pray for months and get nothing that (s)he awards to God, whereas one may never pray and award something to God. Then, this God's existence theory is not reliable.

            1.1.10.9.3.1.4. Con:
            God may not answer prayers offered as part of a prayer study. Therefore, such findings don't prove that God doesn't exist.

              1.1.10.9.3.1.4.1. Pro:
              Biblically, prayers are answered only when one truly believes and has faith that their prayers will be answered. A prayer study, by nature, entails skepticism and doubt. Therefore, prayer studies are inappropriate to test their effectiveness.

          1.1.10.9.3.2. Pro:
          According to 1 Kings 18:24 [302], God would answer in very specific ways when you call on his name.

          1.1.10.9.3.3. Pro:
          According to the Mark 16:18 [303], if God existed people who believed in Him would be able to drink deadly poison and not be hurt at all. That has been demonstrated false [304].

            1.1.10.9.3.3.1. Con:
            Not everything included in Bible is literal in eyes of every Christian. Therefore proving that some fragment is not literaly true is not enough to show that main thoughts of Bible are false.

            1.1.10.9.3.3.2. Con:
            Even if it would prove the non-existence of Christian God it is not a proof for the non-existence of a classical God, which is the topic of this discussion.

            1.1.10.9.3.3.3. Con:
            The linked incident does not meet the conditions that are described in Mark. Notably, they violate scriptures prohibiting tempting the Lord [305], or attempting to make Him perform just to see a miracle (Matthew 4:7).

            1.1.10.9.3.3.4. Con:
            Acording to Luke 17:6 [306] if we would have faith as a mustard seed we could move mountains; even greatest saints haven't done that, therefore it is hard to determine whether people included have enough faith.

          1.1.10.9.3.4. Con:
          There are mathematical theories which prove that some theories can't be proven nor disproven. Same could apply to some establishing existence of some being.

            Undecidable [307] problems cannot be solved.

              1.1.10.9.3.4.1.1. Pro:
              Semidecidable problems that are not decidable contain a subproblem that is impossible to solve.

              1.1.10.9.3.4.1.2. Con:
              This is not true of all undecidable problems. Some undecidable problems are semi-decidable [308], meaning that either a true positive or true negative result can be attained in finite time, while an attempt to prove the opposite case will never terminate. Semi-decidability provides an exact analog for falsifiability.

        1.1.10.9.4. Pro:
        Claims about God have to be falsifiable [309] before they can be experimentally tested. (Popper, 1959 [310])

          1.1.10.9.4.1. Con:
          Christianity does make falsifiable claims. For example, if God created the universe, we would expect it to have begun at some point. Therefore the universe not having ever begun would be evidence contrary the Christian narrative. Also examples: the resurrection of Jesus and surrounding events, human nature, and even the existence of anything at all bzw. Theism.

          1.1.10.9.4.2. Pro:
          When making the null hypothesis, "God does not exist," one must define "God" before accepting or rejecting the hypothesis. However, there is no universal definition of God, so his existence cannot be empirically tested or proven.

            1.1.10.9.4.2.1. Con:
            A poor or weak definition is not evidence for the existence or non-existence of the entity being defined.

          1.1.10.9.4.3. Pro:
          Falsifiability [311] is required to prove that something is or is not true and cannot be achieved without a measurable focus. As God is not measurable, the scientific method cannot be used to test the validity of god.

            1.1.10.9.4.3.1. Con:
            There are numerous examples of nonfalsifiable ideas that we hold as true. This claim makes the assumption that only measurable things are things that exist. Examples of nonfalsifiable things that’s everyone accepts as valid thoughts: the existence of other minds, love, the laws of logic and reason, various unprovable numerical/mathematical axioms, etc. clearly falsifiability is not the only test for truth.

            1.1.10.9.4.3.2. Con:
            To the extent that you can not use the scientific method to test the validity of God this is true. However this suggests that, as God is not a scientific theory, the scientific approach is wrong. It would be the same to try to scientifically demonstrate the existence of love or other abstract concepts.

              1.1.10.9.4.3.2.1. Con:
              There is no problem to demonstrate existence of love scientifically. It exists as a social phenomenon and behaviour of people.

              1.1.10.9.4.3.2.2. Con:
              Abstract concepts can be and have been modelled scientifically for example in computer science. Software Design patterns [312] Abstraction in computer science [313] Category theory [314]

                1.1.10.9.4.3.2.2.1. Con:
                A software design pattern is an abstraction... until it is implemented. Then it is a concrete implementation of an abstract pattern.

            1.1.10.9.4.3.3. Con:
            Falsifiability serves as a test for a scientific theory, but positive evidence can maintain a theory as scientific despite failing the falsifiability test.

              1.1.10.9.4.3.3.1. Pro:
              For example, Darwin said that the fossil record is incomplete and serves as the biggest objection to his theory. The fossil record still poses a problem for evolution, but in light of other positive evidence the theory continues to be accepted by the majority of scientists.

              1.1.10.9.4.3.3.2. Con:
              Falsifiability or other scientific principles would not require completeness of the fossil record. It does require that when new measurements are made, the theories adapt to include the new evidence to the extent it's valid. Usually accepted theories are very resistant to new evidence (they include it already).

                1.1.10.9.4.3.3.2.1. Con:
                The existence of God is an accepted theory. It is resistant to new evidence. The theory does adapt to include the new evidence.

          1.1.10.9.4.4. Pro:
          The concept of God is unfalsifiable.

            1.1.10.9.4.4.1. Pro:
            God, or Gods, have evolved as human understanding [315] of the world around them has increased until we have reached a position where the current depiction is unknowable and unseeable. This is an example of shifting the goal posts of falsifiability.

              1.1.10.9.4.4.1.1. Pro:
              Instead of treating the claim of the existence of a God or Gods, as falsifiable, mankind continued to shift the cultural relationship of Gods until the current depiction because unknowable and unseeable.

            1.1.10.9.4.4.2. Con:
            Many concepts of God have been falsified.

              1.1.10.9.4.4.2.1. Con:
              Unfalsifiablity of a claim about concept of God does not imply that the claim is false. And it does not imply that the claim is true.

              1.1.10.9.4.4.2.2. Con:
              Even if many arguments for the existence of God have been falsified, it does not follow that all such arguments will be falsified.

                1.1.10.9.4.4.2.2.1. Pro:
                2+2 has exactly one correct answer, namely 4. It has an infinite number of incorrect answers.

                  1.1.10.9.4.4.2.2.1.1. Con:
                  2+2 only has one correct answer in our numeral system, currently 4. Another numeral system [316] has an infinite number of correct and incorrect answers.

                1.1.10.9.4.4.2.2.2. Con:
                There would be no material way to differentiate a false description of God from a correct one.

                1.1.10.9.4.4.2.2.3. Con:
                While this is theoretically correct, in context, there no reason to assume that a new formulation of God could not be falsified in the same way other formulations have.

            1.1.10.9.4.4.3. Pro:
            If God cannot be disproven, then it is unfalsifiable and hence not a meaningful idea.

              1.1.10.9.4.4.3.1. Con:
              An idea that cannot be disproven can also be true and can be proven. If proven it becomes extremely meaningful. While unproven it sensible to look for proof. It is prudent to restrict the search for truth to ideas which can possibly be true. Ideas that cannot be proven false remain possible truths.

              1.1.10.9.4.4.3.2. Con:
              The above claim implies a false equivalency. Namely it conflates Russell's Tea pot (a meaningless claim by any measure) with ideas of great consequence. Whether there is a tea pot orbiting the sun or not has no consequence, but if there is a metaphysical reality and God there are profound implications.

              1.1.10.9.4.4.3.3. Con:
              A bomb threat cannot be proven a hoax or bluff yet authorities take bomb threats very seriously. Authorities take bomb threats seriously for the same reasons we should take the inquiry into God's existence seriously. It's possible that a bomb threat is real, and the consequences of such are serious.

              1.1.10.9.4.4.3.4. Con:
              The assertion that everything will one day have natural explanations cannot be disproven and is therefore not scientific.

          1.1.10.9.4.5. Con:
          Assuming that infalsifiable claims are false, by default, makes better pragmatic sense.

            1.1.10.9.4.5.1. Pro:
            There is nothing which can be demonstrably completely true or completely false. All Science does is tend to confirm or tend to deny. Pragmatically assuming that the unfalsifiable is false is as close to actually finding something to be false as is possible.

              1.1.10.9.4.5.1.1. Con:
              It is demonstrably completely true that that which is defined as violet light has the following properties, A wavelength of 380-450nm, a frequency of 670-790 THz and a phontonic energy of 2.75-3.26 eV. Conversely it is demonstrably completely false that violet light has a wavelength of 1100-1450nm.

                1.1.10.9.4.5.1.1.1. Con:
                If one defines violet light by these physical properties, it is a statement of a definition and not of a fact.

                1.1.10.9.4.5.1.1.2. Con:
                It is impossible to demonstrate these physical properties to a Boltzmann brain, or a butterfly dreaming it is Zhuang Zhou, which is sufficient to fail "demonstrably completely true".

                  1.1.10.9.4.5.1.1.2.1. Con:
                  Not being able to demonstrate something to an entity which cannot be shown to exist does not discount that a thing can be demonstrated. This is akin to saying that if something cannot be demonstrated to a round square it cannot be completely true. Ignoring the fact that a round square, or Boltzmann's brain, are thought experiments rather than actual things.

                    1.1.10.9.4.5.1.1.2.1.1. Con:
                    A Boltzmann brain is a solipsistic entity that's hallucinating a whole universe around it, a universe that doesn't really exist. The point is that the universe you observe might be a hallucination, asking whether there are actual observable Boltzmann brains in the real cosmos outside your head is an irrelevant, silly question.

            1.1.10.9.4.5.2. Con:
            The Higgs Bosun particle was first theorized [317] in 1964. At this time, the theory was not falsifiable. Technology had not progressed to a point that the theory could be experimentally tested. Assuming this theory is false, just because it could not be falsified, would be incorrect.

            1.1.10.9.4.5.3. Con:
            Assuming the unfalsifiable claims as false gives the claims more credibility than they actually deserve. To be scientifically rigorous, unfalsifiable claims must be clearly distinguished from claims experimentally provable as true and from claims experimentally provable as false.

          1.1.10.9.4.6. Pro:
          Unfalsifiable claims are neither true nor false: "It is not even wrong [318]."

          1.1.10.9.4.7. Con:
          Unfalsifiable claims that are true can be verified, only unfalsifiable claims that are false cannot be verified.

          1.1.10.9.4.8. Pro:
          Reproducibility is a core component of the scientific method. Experiments may often require more resources to reproduce than an amateur has access to, but if someone has the resources to actually replicate an experiment, and the attempted replication fails, this is a serious problem for a theory and no scientist should simply assert "you must have done something wrong, or missed an interfering variable".

            1.1.10.9.4.8.1. Con:
            If a hypothesis has been reproduced sufficiently to the point of being accepted as a theory then if a student fails to reproduce it they will be told they did something wrong.

              1.1.10.9.4.8.1.1. Pro:
              The benefits of spiritual practices have been reproduced by a significant number of people throughout recorded history and is to this day experienced by a large number.

    1.1.11. Con:
    If God created this reality as a test to judge our faith, then scientific evidence of his existence would be deliberately made hard if not impossible.

      1.1.11.1. Pro:
      The Bible records that miraculous events by Jesus Christ rightly credited to Him were not to be credited to him openly. (Matt. 8:4)studylight.org [319]

      1.1.11.2. Con:
      While conceivably possible, this no more makes God's existence likely despite a lack of evidence than the hiddenness of the wizarding world of Harry Potter makes it likely that said wizarding world exists in real life under our noses despite a lack of evidence.

      1.1.11.3. Con:
      An all knowing, all powerful God would know the results of the test before commencing the test. Therefore, there is no reason to perform the test.

      1.1.11.4. Con:
      To exist is to "have objective reality or being". To have objective reality or being, there must be evidence that proves it. How difficult proof is to find has no bearing on whether said proof is necessary to have existence. Without evidence, God cannot by definition exist.

      1.1.11.5. Pro:
      The evidence might originate from the enemy of the God, or might be placed as a temptation.

        1.1.11.5.1. Pro:
        One of the crucial concepts in Bible is concept of snake which deceives Eve, and Satan as the tempter. It is possible he would provide false evidence to trick people

          1.1.11.5.1.1. Con:
          Genesis 2-3 [320] outlines that god told Adam and Eve that if they ate from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, they would die which was not the case. The serpent rightly advises Eve that eating from it will cause her to know good and evil which was in fact, the case. God is the one who is deceiving in this story.

          1.1.11.5.1.2. Con:
          According to this narrative, until Adam & Eve ate from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, they would not have had the knowledge that disobedience to god was evil in the first place, and thus we innocents placed in an impossible position by god.

          1.1.11.5.1.3. Con:
          The story illustrates that God fails to meet the definition of the god of classic theism. It shows that either god was incapable of stopping the serpent (showing a lack of omnipotence), did not foresee the serpent's tempting, (showing a lack of omniscience) or opted to setup the scenario intentionally (showing a lack of omnibenevolence).

        1.1.11.5.2. Con:
        Any evidence that does not suit the believer in God might be interpreted as false evidence provided by enemy of the God.

        1.1.11.5.3. Con:
        Most definitions of a god see it as the creator of everything. The "enemy of god" would be created by god itself. Therefore, the god would hide itself and not actually be hidden by someone else.

        1.1.11.5.4. Con:
        It is difficult to believe in an all knowing and almighty God who has an enemy and that this loving God allows us to be tricked by him. There are simpler and less convoluted explanations for things being as they are.

        1.1.11.5.5. Con:
        Neither the existence of the enemy of God nor God himself have been established let alone a talking snake.

      1.1.11.6. Pro:
      The lack of verifiable empirical support for God's existence is consistent with a religious worldview that depends on faith, suggesting that it is possible for God to specifically avoid non-faith-based forms of verification.

        1.1.11.6.1. Con:
        If God cannot be verified, that he does not exist remains a simpler explanation than that he is hiding.

        1.1.11.6.2. Con:
        Faith is not a form of verification, and a benevolent God would not reward or depend on human insanity.

        1.1.11.6.3. Pro:
        God wants humanity to believe in Him, so He will never be proven by scientific evidence; only real faith can prove the existence of God.

          1.1.11.6.3.1. Con:
          God can be proven through inductive reasoning, and often with the help of science.

          1.1.11.6.3.2. Con:
          Faith is incapable of proving anything. Literally any position could be taken up and justified as faith. As such, it can't demonstrate what is actually true.

        1.1.11.6.4. Con:
        -> See 1.1.11.6.3.2.

      1.1.11.7. Con:
      A just God could not possibly condemn us for not believing in him as he is doing such a good job in concealing the evidence for his existence. And yet we are told he does indeed condemn us for infidelity.

      1.1.11.8. Con:
      An arbitrary, eccentric and quixotic "hiding" God is neither just nor compassionate and so not worthy of worship.

        1.1.11.8.1. Pro:
        Such as god would fail the requirements of the god of classical theism as they would not be omnibenevolent.

  1.2. Pro:
  Testimonial evidence of divine revelations and religious experiences supports the existence of God.

    1.2.1. Pro:
    The holy scriptures of major world religions support the existence of God.

      1.2.1.1. Pro:
      The Book of Mormon provides reasonable evidence of the existence of God.

        1.2.1.1.1. Pro:
        The Book of Mormon [321] chronicles the lives of the people and prophets of God who lived in the Americas from approximately 600 BC to AD 400, all of it chiseled by the hands of those who lived it.

          1.2.1.1.1.1. Con:
          It's a story about the beliefs of several people. Even if the story itself is historically true, that does not make the beliefs true.

            1.2.1.1.1.1.1. Pro:
            People have believed that some women were witches. [322] That does not means that witches existed.

          1.2.1.1.1.2. Con:
          The Book of Mormon makes claims regarding early inhabitants of the Americas, many of which are demonstrably false [323].

        1.2.1.1.2. Con:
        The Book of Mormon provides claims of the existence of a god. The claims themselves cannot be the evidence as that is circular reasoning.

          1.2.1.1.2.1. Con:
          The Book of Mormon, Another Testament of Jesus Christ, substantiates the claims of the existence of God from the Old Testament and New Testament of the Bible and thus it is not circular reasoning.

        1.2.1.1.3. Con:
        Central to the Book of Mormon is the claim of direct origin from Hebrews of indigenous Americans. This is floridly inaccurate [324] and ahistorical, rendering the Book of Mormon at best an incomplete source of truth.

        1.2.1.1.4. Con:
        Joseph Smith [325] was a well known charlatan for his time, and ended up being murdered by his own followers after it was revealed he was deceiving them. There's no evidence that the Book of Mormon [326] is anything other than fiction.

      1.2.1.2. Pro:
      The Quran offers proof and evidence for the existence of God.

        1.2.1.2.1. Con:
        There are reasons to doubt the veracity of the claims made in the Quran.

          1.2.1.2.1.1. Pro:
          The Quran makes reference to Jinni, but no such entities have been demonstrated to exist.

            1.2.1.2.1.1.1. Con:
            Since the Jinn are portrayed in Islam to be metaphysical, physical evidence cannot exist.

          1.2.1.2.1.2. Pro:
          The Quran claims the moon was split, but there is no historical or scientific evidence this ever happened, and evidence that it did not happen.

            1.2.1.2.1.2.1. Con:
            King Chakrawati Farmas of Malabar, who was a Chera king of the state of Kerala in India, recorded [327] the happening of that event. He lived in the same time period as prophet Mohammed.

              1.2.1.2.1.2.1.1. Con:
              This account is considered by historians and scholars to be legendary [328], rather than factual.

                1.2.1.2.1.2.1.1.1. Pro:
                The king was a known contemporary of a figure known to have lived during the late 7th and early 8th centuries, whereas Mohammed lived during the late 6th and early 7th. Thus, the king could not possibly have witnessed an event that took place in Muhammad's adulthood.

            1.2.1.2.1.2.2. Pro:
            Geological studies of the moon offer no evidence the moon was ever split and rejoined. NASA Lunar Science Institute scientist Brad Bailey stated "No current scientific evidence reports that the Moon was split into two (or more) parts and then reassembled at any point in the past." [329]

            1.2.1.2.1.2.3. Pro:
            The splitting of the moon would have violated the laws of conservation of energy/momentum.

            1.2.1.2.1.2.4. Con:
            The Mayans recorded [330] this happening. This counts as historical evidence.

              1.2.1.2.1.2.4.1. Con:
              This claim that the Mayans saw a cleft moon is based on a dubious and unsupported interpretation of a symbol [331] in a Mayan manuscript [332] dating back to around 1300 CE [333], 700 years after the alleged event [334]. This evidence is wholly insufficient to justify the claim that Mayans witnessed the alleged miracle of the splitting of the moon.

          1.2.1.2.1.3. Pro:
          Islam teaches that Allah created the world in six days [335]. Yet, there is a body of research demonstrating that it was created over billions of years [336]. It follows that either Allah is not as taught by Islam, or he does not exist.

          1.2.1.2.1.4. Con:
          An example is the Quran’s unveiling of many secrets of Ancient Egyptian Civilization, more than a 1000 years before the world uncovered these secrets empirically. [337]

        1.2.1.2.2. Pro:
        The Quranic challenge as a whole (inimitability, preservation, non-contradiction, and unlikely predictions) is not disputed in any rigorous knowledge discipline. This shows that the Quran is authored by Allah.

          1.2.1.2.2.1. Con:
          The Quran is not inimitable. Any text can be imitated, even if only by random chance [338].

          1.2.1.2.2.2. Con:
          Literary quality is subjective, so the inimitability of the Quran is only a matter of opinion and thus cannot prove God's existence.

          1.2.1.2.2.3. Con:
          Arguing that the Quranic teachings are true because they have yet to be falsified commits the fallacy of making an argument from ignorance [339], and thus should be rejected.

          1.2.1.2.2.4. Con:
          Inimitability is more likely evidence of factual inaccuracy than accuracy; assuming we occupy the same objective reality, one would expect multiple texts describing the fabric of existence to converge.

          1.2.1.2.2.5. Pro:
          The Quranic text is the only ancient text of the Abrahamic texts that is pristinely preserved [340] from a historical and testimonial sense.

            1.2.1.2.2.5.1. Con:
            Other comparably old texts are well preserved. We have texts from 3000 BCE in the originals. [341]

            1.2.1.2.2.5.2. Con:
            The standardization and apparent uniformity of the Quranic text can be largely attributed to Uthman burning all the textual variants after establishing a single canonical copy [342]. As destruction is the opposite of preservation, it cannot be said that the Quran has been "pristinely preserved" over its history.

          1.2.1.2.2.6. Con:
          The Quran was supposedly revealed only in Arabic. [343] This contradicts Allah's status as a non-human overseeing all the world's people. If Allah truly ruled all humans eternally, he'd lack any special interest in Arabic, which is a major language in only one region.

            1.2.1.2.2.6.1. Pro:
            Allah could have revealed his law through all languages directly without the aid of human translators. The exclusivity of this revelation to Arabic speakers (and only one at that, Muhammad) shows that the Quran has its origins in Arabs.

          1.2.1.2.2.7. Pro:
          The quality of Qur'an, both in content and in form is so great, that it must have been the work of God. It is not possible for a human to write anything like it (inimitability [344])

          1.2.1.2.2.8. Pro:
          The fact that there are no contradictions [345] in the Qur’an, despite being revealed over the twenty-three year period, under different circumstances, addressing different problems, is a clear indication of its divine origin.

        1.2.1.2.3. Pro:
        The Holy Qur’an predicted [346] and foretold several events with total confidence and categorical details. The only justified answer to the cause of the precise accuracy of the predictions is that it was revealed by Allah.

          1.2.1.2.3.1. Pro:
          “The Byzantines have been defeated. In the nearest land. But they, after their defeat, will triumph. Within three to nine years.” Byzantines were defeated and did rebound in 3-9 years in a near land [347] to where the verses were revealed.

            1.2.1.2.3.1.1. Con:
            The Persians defeated the Byzantines and captured Jerusalem at about 614-615 CE. The Byzantine counter-offensive did not begin until 622 CE and the victory was not complete until 628 CE, making it a period of around 13-14 years, not 3-9, as claimed in the Quran [348].

            1.2.1.2.3.1.2. Con:
            As the prophecy covers a range of 6 years, it is not "precise," as claimed in the grandparent claim.

              1.2.1.2.3.1.2.1. Con:
              In the context of warfare and unlikely victories, a 6 or even 20 year range of a prediction of such outcome is so improvable that it is perhaps inhuman; as it unfound in other history.

              1.2.1.2.3.1.2.2. Pro:
              A precise claim would specify the day, or at least the year. If the claim is being given by the creator and governor of the universe, the claim should be arbitrarily precise, not a range of 6 years.

            1.2.1.2.3.1.3. Con:
            Given the Persian capture of Jerusalem in 614, the imminent retaliation of the more powerful Byzantines was not unlikely, as claimed in the grandparent claim.

              1.2.1.2.3.1.3.1. Con:
              The Byzantines were at a great disadvantage, as they, from 613-619 CE, were decimated by the Persian Empire, losing the territories of Antioch, then Damascus, then Armenia, then their most cherished Jerusalem, then Chalcedon, and finally Egypt.

                1.2.1.2.3.1.3.1.1. Pro:
                In his book, The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Edward Gibbon says, “At the time when this prediction is said to have been delivered, no prophecy could be more distant from its accomplishment, since the first twelve years of Heraclius announced the approaching dissolution of the empire.”

                  1.2.1.2.3.1.3.1.1.1. Pro:
                  Everyone saw Byzantium as on its deathbed; to the degree that opponents of the Prophet ﷺ like Ubayy b. Khalaf mocked this “preposterous” foretelling in the Qur’an.

                1.2.1.2.3.1.3.1.2. Con:
                The recent loss made a future victory more likely, as Eastern Rome would undoubtedly regroup to launch an overwhelming attack to regain what she had lost, which she had only lost for 10-20 years.

                  1.2.1.2.3.1.3.1.2.1. Con:
                  The sections “recent loss made a future victory more likely” goes against reason because a loss of a battle entails losing influence, land, resources, men, reputation, and patience. A retrospective look may look simpler and clearer, but predicting the future is much more difficult.

                  1.2.1.2.3.1.3.1.2.2. Con:
                  The use of “undoubtedly” here is perhaps due to the attribution error fallacy. Looking at history, one might think everything makes sense and every betrayal makes sense. However, evidence posted on this discussion suggests that that period was named the decline and fall of the Byzantine empire, even by european writers of the time.

          1.2.1.2.3.2. Pro:
          The Quran states: (Today We shall preserve your body that you may be a sign to those after you: although most men give no heed to Our signs. (Yunus, 10.92)) speaking of Ramses ||, an ancient Pharoh of egypt. (13:00-14:06) [349]. In the contemporary era, a Pharoh’s body was retrieved intact, and was identified to be Ramses || [350].

            1.2.1.2.3.2.1. Pro:
            If the Quran was to predict an event so unlikely, so specific, futuristic, and verifiable, Allah argues this would be a miraculous feat that is not comparable to human capacity.

              1.2.1.2.3.2.1.1. Con:
              This claim was not time-bound as the prophecy never indicates any specific time when it would be clear whether or not it came true. Whether the body was found 2 years ago, 20 years ago, or 200 or 2000 years in the future, the prophecy would be claimed confirmed.

              1.2.1.2.3.2.1.2. Con:
              The prophecy is not strictly verifiable as it is entirely possible that the body could have been lost or destroyed. The fact that it wasn't is merely chance.

              1.2.1.2.3.2.1.3. Con:
              As many pharaohs had their bodies preserved by mummification, the claim isn't terribly unlikely.

            1.2.1.2.3.2.2. Con:
            This passage is not clearly about Rameses II. That seems like a post hoc interpretation.

            1.2.1.2.3.2.3. Con:
            Up until 2 years ago, this would not have been evidence. As Islam had been around for far longer, it is clear that Muslims in no way depended on this to justify their belief in God.

              1.2.1.2.3.2.3.1. Con:
              Muslims never claim that the time of revelation of any evidence has a bearing on whether it should be considered, keeping their intellectual integrity intact.

                1.2.1.2.3.2.3.1.1. Con:
                To claim that the time of revelation has no bearing on the consideration of evidence amounts to an admission of accepting whatever confirmatory points can be found and ignoring any and all points that aren't confirmatory. In other words, it's an admission of confirmation bias.

                  1.2.1.2.3.2.3.1.1.1. Con:
                  The timing of a prophecy’s fulfillment is essential, like other elements, because it can contribute to the mysteriousness that makes something a prophecy rather than a mere promise. While a promise is informative, a prophecy creates space for fear, hope, and faith which are essential for spiritual understanding.

                    1.2.1.2.3.2.3.1.1.1.1. Pro:
                    The Quran and Hadith issue prophecies often framed as such, and at times more subtly. If more than 10 clearly framed prophecies are true, and they stand the Islamic definition of a prophecy, the likeliness of their occurrence together would be virtually zero.

                  1.2.1.2.3.2.3.1.1.2. Con:
                  Not knowing when a prophecy come true is specific to one kind of prophecy in Islam.

                  1.2.1.2.3.2.3.1.1.3. Con:
                  Not knowing the time of fulfillment is the one, and cherished, form of mystery God can incorporate into his prophecies. Ultimately, Islam claims sufficient evidence for God’s existence, never proof.

                  1.2.1.2.3.2.3.1.1.4. Pro:
                  The Quranic prophecies are either interpreted after the fact to correspond to past events, or the prophecies are open ended and can then await fulfillment indefinitely. Thus, there can never be an unfulfilled prophecy: if a prophecy hasn't been fulfilled, it will be sometime in the future, or perhaps it has been fulfilled, and we just don't know it yet. As this precludes unfulfilled prophecies, it is unsurprising that there are no unfulfilled prophecies.

                1.2.1.2.3.2.3.1.2. Pro:
                A prophecy may appear to be fulfilled, then after investigation turns to be a false positive. Muslims will not judge the time of the revelation of evidence because time is always considered in the prophecy itself respectively.

                1.2.1.2.3.2.3.1.3. Pro:
                Prophecies vary in their relation to time measure from strictly time bound, to remotely time-bound, to implied, to open ended and other circumstance. Prophecies. In all cases, Muslims will engage all evidence as it seems relevant.

              1.2.1.2.3.2.3.2. Con:
              Islam is concerned with developing and finessing its arguments as time goes by, besides being blessed with prophecy after prophecy being fulfilled to add on new arguments.

              1.2.1.2.3.2.3.3. Pro:
              If finding the body counts in favor of Islam, increasing the support for the belief in God, until that happened, the unsubstantiated prediction would have counted against Islam, reducing the support for the belief in God. As this reduction in support didn't happen, the new evidence cannot count as an increase in support.

                1.2.1.2.3.2.3.3.1. Pro:
                If the conditional probability of A given B is higher than the unconditional probability of A, it necessarily follows that the conditional probability of A given not-B is lower than the unconditional probability of A. In other words, if presence of evidence is evidence of presence, absence of evidence is evidence of absence.

            1.2.1.2.3.2.4. Con:
            As other Pharaohs had been preserved (mummification being well known), correctly predicting the preservation of one more Pharaoh (even if the whereabouts of the body aren't yet known) is not very impressive, and doesn't indicate any sort of divine influence.

            1.2.1.2.3.2.5. Con:
            In context [351], this is obviously supposed to be the head-on-a-pike kind of 'example', so the fact that Ramesses II lived to about 90 [352] and was remembered as 'The Great', and 9 more pharaohs took the name Ramesses in his honour, refutes it.

              1.2.1.2.3.2.5.1. Con:
              The age of Ramses has no bearing on the truth of the prophecy. The Quranic prophecy does not depict him as a young lad nor does it depict him as being of any age.

                1.2.1.2.3.2.5.1.1. Con:
                Leading an army in pursuit of escaping slaves is not an act of an arthritic 90-year-old.

                  1.2.1.2.3.2.5.1.1.1. Con:
                  While a a 90-year-old pharaoh would struggle to pursue individuals, they would be more than capable of leading the hunt by delegating the task to others.

                  1.2.1.2.3.2.5.1.1.2. Con:
                  An arthritic 90 year old man can lead an army politically, physically, and militarily.

            1.2.1.2.3.2.6. Con:
            This verse relates to the pharaoh of the exodus, who is popularly considered [353] to be Ramesses II, but the exodus narrative has little or no [354] historical basis.

            1.2.1.2.3.2.7. Con:
            The verse in question is referring to the Biblical story of the crossing of the Sea of Reeds [355]. As Rameses II did not die there, but rather from diseases or old age (he died at 90), it is not true that God preserved his body "today", as stated in the verse. Nor could it have been preserved "as an example/sign" as it was given a royal burial and was then not known for hundreds of years.

        1.2.1.2.4. Con:
        The complete compilation of of the Quran does not appear to have occured until some 12 to 24 years [356] after the fact, with many earlier manuscripts [357] existing before that time being destroyed and potentially several chapters [358] excluded from the book.

      1.2.1.3. Con:
      All theological and religious arguments for the existence of god are circular. Hence, there are no valid religious or theological arguments for the existence of god.

        1.2.1.3.1. Pro:
        All arguments for the existence of God based on holy Scripture are circular, as they first require showing the scripture is Holy, which assumes that there is a God.

          1.2.1.3.1.1. Pro:
          You can't prove the existence of the author of a writing with the argument that it's written in the writing. It is written in the Hobbit, or there and back again [359] that Bilbo Baggins is writing "there and back again" therefore Bilbo Baggins exists. Yet we know that Bilbo Baggins is a fictional character invented by Tolkien.

        1.2.1.3.2. Pro:
        Genuine theology cannot exist without a god to study. Thus, no sound argument for the existence of God can come from theology.

        1.2.1.3.3. Con:
        This claim is not about the Bible claiming it is true. It is about the Bible containing scientific facts and ethical principles which are ahead of their time and predictions of the future which can reasonably be explained by devine inspritation.

          1.2.1.3.3.1. Con:
          Bible "ahead of their times" scientific facts are useless since we needed to develop science to confirm them, also they have been debunked [360].

          1.2.1.3.3.2. Con:
          Other traditions [361] had comparable or superior ethical principles before the Bible was compiled.

          1.2.1.3.3.3. Con:
          Predictions of the future can be more reasonably explained by post events edits, and anyway have been debunked [362].

      1.2.1.4. Con:
      The Bible has evidence of a hierarchy of Gods; this implies that biblical religions are polytheistic rather than monotheistic. This contradicts the classical definition of God, which is monotheistic.

        1.2.1.4.1. Pro:
        God's divine council or sôd [363] shows that ancient Israelite belief in God was more a form of Monolatry [364] than it was Monotheism.

          1.2.1.4.1.1. Pro:
          The Hebrew Bible has a variety of terms [365] referring to the divine council or sôd.

            1.2.1.4.1.1.1. Pro:
            The Assembly of God (עדת-אל; ‘ădat ’ēl) refers to the divine council (Psalm 82:1 [366] HIB).

            The Council of the Holy Ones (סוד קדשים; sôd qĕdôshîm) refers to the divine council (Psalm 89:7 [368] HIB).

            1.2.1.4.1.1.4. Pro:
            The Council of Yahweh (סוד יהוה; sôd yhwh) refers to the divine council (Jeremiah 23:18 [369] HIB).

            1.2.1.4.1.1.5. Pro:
            The Council of God (סוד אלוה; sôd ’ĕlôh) refers to the divine council (Job 15:8 [370] HIB).

          1.2.1.4.1.2. Pro:
          Like a royal court [371] has different members with different roles and purposes, the divine council or sôd has a variety of heavenly beings [372] with different roles and purposes where Jehovah is served by these lesser deities.

            1.2.1.4.1.2.1. Pro:
            Gods (אלים / אלהים; ’ēlîm / ’ēlōhîm) are part of Jehovah's divine council (Exodus 15:11 [373]; Deuteronomy 10:17 [374]; 32:8,43 [375] DSS; Joshua 22:22 [376]; Psalm 8:5 [377]; 82:1,6 [378]; 86:8 [379]; 95:3 [380]; 96:4 [381]; 97:9 [382];135:5 [383]; 138:1 [384]).

            Morning Stars (כוכבי בקר; kôkbê bôqer)" are part of Jehovah's divine council (Job 38:7 [390] HIB).

              1.2.1.4.1.2.3.1. Pro:
              Since Christ is God and is called the "the bright and morning star" in Revelation 22:16 [391], the "morning stars" in Job 38:7 [392] are also gods.

          The Enhanced Brown-Driver-Briggs Hebrew and English Lexicon defines sôd [410] as both a "council, in familiar conversation … divan or circle of familiar friends … assembly, company” as well as a “counsel, taken by those in familiar conversation … secret counsel, which may be revealed."

        1.2.1.4.2. Con:
        Deuteronomy 6:4 [411] clearly demonstrates that the ancient Israelites believed in monotheism.

          1.2.1.4.2.1. Con:
          The Hebrew word for one "e·ḥāḏ [412]" in Deuteronomy 6:4 [413] does not make a strong case for ancient Israelite monotheistic beliefs. "e·ḥāḏ [414]" is also found in Genesis 11:5-8 [415] where it says the "people is one". They were one, not because they were of one being or one essence, but because they were of one mind in building the Tower of Babel. The Lord also uses the phrase "Let us go down" in verse 7. This implies that multiple others were with the Lord in going down and confounding their language.

        1.2.1.4.3. Pro:
        Christ, who is God, said that the Father, who is also God, is greater than he is (John 14:28 [416]), the Father is the only true God (John 17:3 [417]), and that he is greater than all (John 10:29 [418]), demonstrating a hierarchy of Gods within the trinity.

        1.2.1.4.4. Pro:
        Christ, who is God (Philippians 2:5-11 [419]), said God is greater than men (Job 33:12 [420]) and also referred to men as gods (Psalms 82:6-7 [421], John 10:33-36 [422]), which shows there is a hierarchy of Gods.

        1.2.1.4.5. Pro:
        The first commandment advises "You shall have no other gods before me" and which implies the existence of other gods. If other gods do not exist, it is nonsensical to state this instead of simply clarifying that no other gods exist.

          1.2.1.4.5.1. Con:
          Unlike many other parts of the Bible, this part is not clear in what it implies or whether it can readily be interpreted this way: what could be meant there is that believers should not also believe in other gods as in polytheism or believing that one or some other monotheistic Gods may also be real or possibly the only real one(s). It makes sense for a religion to perpetuate this as it enables a faster and more robust spread, especially since claims of afterlife may facilitate them to do so.

            1.2.1.4.5.1.2. Con:
            An Omniscient god would know it's instructions are unclear and subject to interpretation. Thus is either not Omniscient or not Omnibenevolent due to spreading confusion.

            1.2.1.4.5.1.3. Con:
            The admission of potential other gods existing amounts to rejection that the god of classical theism [423] exists, as defined by the discussion.

      1.2.1.5. Con:
      The existence of polytheistic religions negates this argument.

      1.2.1.6. Con:
      Literature such as the Bible, the Qu'ran, or the Torah cannot be proven to be non-fiction.

        1.2.1.6.1. Pro:
        Such literature often contains magic, miracles and other supernatural claims, even from people [424] operating outside the religion in question, which casts doubt as to the factual accuracy of the text.

        1.2.1.6.2. Pro:
        Such literature has claims which appears to be factually or historically inaccurate, thus reducing the credibility of the work as a whole.

      1.2.1.7. Pro:
      The Bible contains testimonial evidence for the existence of Jesus Christ, which is proof of the existence of God.

        1.2.1.7.1. Pro:
        The New Testament books were written either by eyewitnesses or by scribes based on the stories of eyewitnesses.

          1.2.1.7.1.1. Pro:
          The Pauline epistles [425] are attributed to the apostle Paul, who was an eyewitness to the resurrected Jesus [426].

          1.2.1.7.1.2. Pro:
          Most if not all of the books of the New Testament are dated within the lifetime of eyewitnesses (even by conservative scholars), meaning they could be interviewed about their experiences and would likely notice any discrepancy with what they experienced.

          1.2.1.7.1.3. Pro:
          The four gospels - Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John - were written by eyewitnesses.

            1.2.1.7.1.3.1. Pro:
            It is typically accepted by historians that the Gospel narratives were preserved by oral tradition [427] in the time between Jesus's death and the writing of the four Gospels.

              1.2.1.7.1.3.1.1. Con:
              Oral transmission of information leads to the loss and or distortion of that information. The more generations that pass the more distorted that the information gets.

              1.2.1.7.1.3.1.2. Pro:
              The amount and dates of extant accounts of Jesus's ministry and resurrection are outstanding in ancient history, where writing by eyewitnesses is not common, expected, or required when questioning ancient historical events.

                1.2.1.7.1.3.1.2.1. Pro:
                The first surviving account of Alexander the Great's life came ~200 years after his death, with the next not appearing until ~200 years after that.

              1.2.1.7.1.3.1.3. Pro:
              Oral tradition was much more reliable at the time, when reading and writing were uncommon, and especially among Jewish communities. This tradition is even continued into this day, with sections of the Torah being memorized and recited for bar mitzvahs.

                1.2.1.7.1.3.1.3.1. Con:
                Oral tradition has never been reliable, especially when maintained and spread by uneducated and illiterate people with very little understanding of anything.

            1.2.1.7.1.3.2. Pro:
            Mark and Luke were companions of Peter and Paul, respectively, but are not themselves relevant to the Gospel narrative. If the Church was just assigning authors to the Gospels, they would have chosen more important authors (such as Jesus's original disciples), like the Gnostic Gospels did, rather than unknown names like these.

          1.2.1.7.1.4. Con:
          There is good evidence that the gospels are anonymous accounts [428]

        1.2.1.7.2. Pro:
        Many people believed that they had some sort of experience of Jesus after his death.

          1.2.1.7.2.1. Pro:
          This is attested to by multiple independent sources, including Josephus, Paul, and all four Gospels and Acts. This is also preserved in earlier creeds, such as 1 Corinthians 15:3-7.

          1.2.1.7.2.2. Con:
          It is possible that belief in the resurrection was due to hallucinations.

            1.2.1.7.2.2.1. Con:
            Most postmortem appearances were to multiple witnesses at once, with at least one report of a large group appearance (to 500 people at once). Group hallucinations are incredibly rare, with no known formally documented case, so this is unlikely to have happened multiple times.

            1.2.1.7.2.2.2. Con:
            Witnesses reported seeing, hearing, and sometimes touching the resurrected body. Hallucinations typically only influence one sense, with simultaneous hallucinations in many senses (such as these) being incredibly rare, so this is unlikely to have happened multiple times.

            1.2.1.7.2.2.3. Con:
            If all the witnesses of the resurrected body of Jesus were hallucinating, it's unlikely that their accounts of what he said and did would agree to the extent that they do, since his words and actions would be created independently in each of their minds.

            1.2.1.7.2.2.4. Con:
            If the witnesses of the resurrected body were hallucinating, they likely would have concluded that it was only a vision rather than a bodily resurrection, since we know that both their culture and the specific individuals involved had a concept of spiritual visions.

              1.2.1.7.2.2.4.1. Pro:
              In Acts 12:14-15, a servant tells members of the early Church that Peter had escaped from prison, and she is dismissed with the claim that it was only his angel. This shows that the early Church wasn't quick to assume that the appearance of someone is necessarily their physical presence.

          1.2.1.7.2.3. Con:
          It's possible that early belief in the resurrection was fabricated by later generations.

        1.2.1.7.3. Con:
        -> See discussion #43783: The Bible contains contradictions.

        1.2.1.7.4. Con:
        The disciples never wrote their own accounts of their experience of Jesus. The earliest copies of the books we now call the Gospels date to decades after the occurance of the proported events, and were not authored by the men whose names they are title after.

        1.2.1.7.5. Con:
        There is no contemporary or direct testimony on Jesus. While there are records from Rome during the time he lived, there are zero contemporary references. The gospels appear to have been written at least 48-300 years after the fact [429]. It's implausible that nobody noticed him [430] at the time.

        1.2.1.7.6. Pro:
        The disciples bore testimony to having witnessed the resurrected Jesus along with many others. They bore this testimony even at the cost of their lives.

          1.2.1.7.6.1. Pro:
          The Apostles preached the resurrection immediately in Jerusalem, where the Jewish and Roman authorities were already prepared to combat them, rather than waiting or beginning their ministry elsewhere.

            1.2.1.7.6.1.1. Pro:
            The Roman historian Tacitus mentions that after Jesus's death, Christianity first began to rise in Judea.

            1.2.1.7.6.1.2. Pro:
            Cults are typically formed far away from or long after the events they preach, to avoid being persecuted or disproven.

          1.2.1.7.6.2. Pro:
          The deciples had no reasonable motivation to lie about having witnessed the resurrected Jesus.

            1.2.1.7.6.2.1. Con:
            They may very well have witnessed Jesus, who had nearly died, and returned having narrowly escaped death.

              1.2.1.7.6.2.1.1. Con:
              The Roman soldiers would have broken Jesus' legs to finish the crucifixion process [431] if He were not already dead. Yet even Jesus' enemies knew He died, and one soldier even put a spear in Jesus' side to check if Jesus was dead.

          1.2.1.7.6.3. Con:
          The resurrection account is very weak evidence since the claim is a matter of individual revelation (even though it was several of Jesus' disciples who may have made the claim).
          
          Individual revelation [432] (from 12:00 to 12:40) has an extremely low value (near 0%) as scientific evidence. The evidence relies on whether we believe the disciples of Jesus not.

            1.2.1.7.6.3.1. Con:
            The resurrection account is also based on several group reports (i.e., involving 10+ people)

          1.2.1.7.6.4. Con:
          The disciples may not have even existed and where merely figments of literature.

        1.2.1.7.7. Con:
        Rather then reports of witnesses, what is provided is hearsay in the form of posthumously written texts.

        1.2.1.7.8. Pro:
        Jesus' disciples, who were witness to his life and miracles, identified him as being the Son of God. (See Matthew 16 verses 13-17)

          1.2.1.7.8.1. Con:
          There is documented evidence of the existence of Jim Jones, whose 1000 followers claimed was God, yet the existence of Jim Jones is not clear evidence of the existence of God.

            1.2.1.7.8.1.1. Con:
            Because one person's claim is a lie does not have any bearing on another's claim. This statement neither supports nor undermines the parent claim.

          1.2.1.7.8.2. Con:
          This testimony is only of a man performing some kind of miracles. There are many examples [433] of miracles and other forms of magic being faked throughout history.

            1.2.1.7.8.2.1. Pro:
            People today fake divine power and deeds on YouTube and Christian television shows.

              1.2.1.7.8.2.1.1. Pro:
              Some videos [434] have shown how fake healing shows generate illusory miracles.

            1.2.1.7.8.2.2. Pro:
            Even in the information age, people are still deceived by rather obvious and well known gimmicks (for instance the leg extention [435] "miracles", which are not miraculous [436] at all).

            1.2.1.7.8.2.3. Pro:
            Even in cases where faking miracles is not intentional, a person's actions can be exaggerated and distorted by those who tell and retell the episode.

      1.2.1.8. Con:
      There are questions as to the consistency and accuracy of such scriptures over time between their supposed events, time of recording and potential alteration over time.

        1.2.1.8.2. Pro:
        The Exodus is alleged to has occurred in the 13th century BCE [437] however, tales of the Exodus do not appear until the 8th century BCE [438] and potentially mixed with additions or revisions in the 5th century BCE [439] and even then, do not appear to be uniformly communicated across Israel as a whole through that entire period of time.

        1.2.1.8.5. Pro:
        Prior to Emperor Constantine there were only 21 books that Christians could agree on [440]. 10 others were disputed and some labelled heresy. The Council of Nicea [441] wasn't called until 325CE and the canon's completion took until 397CE [442]. Many of the books that went into the finished product were fabricated, the alleged authors centuries dead. Only the original 21 books stand any chance of being at all authentic.

      1.2.1.9. Pro:
      God spoke to Moses "as a man speaketh to another." Exodus 33:11. [443]

        1.2.1.9.1. Con:
        Auditory and visual psychosis, also known as Distorted Reality [444], has been proven and directly observed. Sufferers of Distorted Reality commonly 'know' that a person, who does not exist from independent observers, there is no evidence that Moses actually spoke to God, only that Moses reported he spoke to God.

        1.2.1.9.2. Con:
        -> See 1.1.7.4.5.

        1.2.1.9.3. Con:
        You cannot use the book stating that God exist as a proof that God exist.

        1.2.1.9.4. Con:
        There is no archaeological or paeleological evidence [445] to suggest Moses existed. In fact, most biblical historians do not believe he existed.

      1.2.1.10. Con:
      There is no agreement between and within major world religions about the existence and nature of God. This implies that either all of them are wrong or only of them is right.

        1.2.1.10.1. Con:
        There is no contradiction between the existence of an absolute almighty power that created the universe and there being multiple contradictory conceptions of this entity.

          1.2.1.10.1.1. Pro:
          If all religions shared an identical understanding of God, this would then necessitate that humans could not freely make up their own minds about him.  Without multiple possible choices, freedom does not exist.  Therefore disagreements about the nature of God are only able to be evidence for humanity not understanding him.

            1.2.1.10.1.1.1. Pro:
            The morality of major religions has changed drastically over time, in line with the Zeitgeist and cultural mores of the time. For example slavery was deemed perfectly moral by most religions 600 years ago, eg. by Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism as well and non-theist  ideologies like Buddhism.

              1.2.1.10.1.1.1.1. Con:
              This does not show a change in morality, but a change in man's perception of morality. 
              
              If it was actually morality itself that changed, then slavery was actually moral in the Southern United States in 1840. In fact, many persons recognized that slavery was immoral during the founding of the nation, and fought to limit its practice in the new country.

            1.2.1.10.1.1.2. Con:
            When something actually exists before us, we are not free to choose its characteristics.

              One may take his painting and change the nature of his painting in any way he chooses therefore this argument is invalid

          1.2.1.10.1.2. Pro:
          Disagreements over the qualities something has doesn't tend to disprove that such a thing exists. In fact, multiple differing perspectives about the same object suggests the thing does exist, but is simply not well understood.

            1.2.1.10.1.2.1. Pro:
            This argument has nothing to do with God - it is a comment on man's autonomy and man's intellect. It is a non-argument in the context of the debate. God's role in this confusion is explained as being of His divine design in response to man's idiocy in Genesis Ch. 11 v.1 to v.9. [446]

              1.2.1.10.1.2.1.1. Con:
              There is no need to hypothesise about God's role in this confusion if God does not exist, so if nothing else the argument makes the God hypothesis less Occamian, which is enough to be more than a non-argument.

            1.2.1.10.1.2.2. Pro:
            This is not an argument that supports the non-existence of God, but an argument that says "Humans cannot yet see beyond contradictions."

              1.2.1.10.1.2.2.1. Con:
              To consider that "Humans cannot yet see beyond contradictions" is to entertain the idea that we hold the logical absolute of the excluded middle in too high esteem. One would have to presuppose the logical absolutes to prove them wrong, and so there is no way around the presupposition that they are true.

              1.2.1.10.1.2.2.2. Con:
              Unless God's existence is assumed, there is no reason to believe there is any need to "see beyond contradictions", so this is begging the question.

                1.2.1.10.1.2.2.2.1. Con:
                It's not necessarily begging the question because what it does is show how the contradictions can be present both in the case of God existing and of God not existing. It thus neutralizes the grandparent claim by establishing the fact that contradictions can be expected to exist in a world in which God exists.

        1.2.1.10.2. Pro:
        The evidence of any religion would confirm the truth of only that religion. And since religions, and their sects, preach mutually incompatible theologies, they may not all be correct.

          1.2.1.10.2.1. Pro:
          If God does exist there would not be this many diverse religions. God would have made it clear that there should exist only one religion.

          1.2.1.10.2.2. Con:
          The evidence for other religions, while potentially detrimental for the exclusive claims of those religions, might still be mutually reinforcing as evidence for the existence of God.

          1.2.1.10.2.3. Pro:
          The existence of a mythology does not inherently support the existence of the gods in said mythology. If that were the case, you would have to acknowledge the existence of Zeus, Ra, Shiva, Odin, etc. alongside the Christian God. The existence of those gods would then render the claim of the Christian God being the only god or "one true god" a falsehood.

            1.2.1.10.2.3.1. Pro:
            The concept of God/s has changed through time reflecting cultures and cultural understandings.  A particular concept of God/s that arose in a definite place and time (within history) cannot be separated from its circumstances.  We might as well argue whether Odin exists or Artemis or Ahura Mazda.  God (YHWH) is merely one more cultural artifact.

              1.2.1.10.2.3.1.1. Pro:
              There are as many concepts of God as cultures, but are "models" (approximations) of God adapted to the reality of each culture / depend on each culture. The reality of God must be beyond / beneath the cultures.

            1.2.1.10.2.3.2. Con:
            A continued strong and active belief in God in spite of extreme persecution over centuries is not the same as a continued knowledge that a people group once believed something, such as in the case of Greek or other mythology. Those belief systems essentially died out and simply became part of history when they went out of political/social favor.

        1.2.1.10.3. Con:
        If the teachings of at least one monotheistic religion are true, it is sufficient to conclude that God exists.

          1.2.1.10.3.1. Pro:
          Islam maintains its classical definition, followed by virtually all Muslims. Allah is defined by his 99 names and attributes mentioned in the Quran and Hadith. Islam maintains that its definition of Allah coheres completely.

            1.2.1.10.3.1.1. Con:
            Islam is not the only religion. The god of Islam is different than and irreconcilable with the God of Christianity (which is a trinity and for which no prophet followed Jesus).

            1.2.1.10.3.1.2. Pro:
            There needs to be only one definition to cohere thoroughly for the problem highlighted by this con to go away.

          1.2.1.10.3.2. Con:
          As many monotheistic faiths claim that the Word of God/Allah is inerrant there is only one logical response. For each, inerrant, word of a God, there is one God. This, in turn, disproves the concept of 'A God of Classical Theism' as there would be many. If however, the Word of God is not inerrant. There is no way to show the teachings of any monotheistic religion as being true.

        1.2.1.10.4. Pro:
        Christianity is far too ideologically diverse to yield one coherent system of belief that all Christians accept.

        1.2.1.10.5. Pro:
        There is no consistency between religious texts, different sects and anecdotal experiences.

          1.2.1.10.5.1. Pro:
          There exist many different religions and beliefs for which God has different goals, attributes and properties, etc. For example see a list of Chistian denominations [447] and their different conceptions of God.

          1.2.1.10.5.2. Con:
          Religious texts, sects and anecdotal experiences could be likened to the different paths climbing a single mountain. People who start from the north would describe a very different geography while travelling - inconsistencies in narrative - from those starting from the south. The ultimate destination, however, remains the same.

          1.2.1.10.5.3. Con:
          There is little consistency between modern recounting of even the most recent events. It does not follow that this lack of consistency is evidence against an event occurring.

        1.2.1.10.6. Pro:
        The non-existence of God is consistent with widely accepted views on the deities of dead, or fringe religions. If all other gods are mythological and created by man, then likely all gods are.

          1.2.1.10.6.1. Pro:
          As a believer of any religion, you have to believe that you are right while all the contradicting religions are wrong. There is no evidence to support such statements, as the evidence for most religions is of similar value, individual experiences and (old) man-written texts.

            1.2.1.10.6.1.1. Pro:
            Most people believe that all faiths, besides theirs, are wrong. Thus, on average, all religions are being rejected by all people, besides the individual believers of a particular faith.

              1.2.1.10.6.1.1.1. Con:
              Christian (JC-LDS) adherents have no doctrine supporting rejecting anyone holding to other belief systems.

              1.2.1.10.6.1.1.2. Pro:
              There is no way of evaluating which one of two religions is truer.

                1.2.1.10.6.1.1.2.1. Con:
                There are many ways of evaluating the relative correctness of any given religion.

                  1.2.1.10.6.1.1.2.1.1. Pro:
                  Historicity, authority, logical coherence, practical results, and anecdotal experience are just some of the ways to evaluate which one is more correct.

                  1.2.1.10.6.1.1.2.1.2. Pro:
                  If a religion contradicts itself, then that is a mark against the correctness of that religion. Therefore, logical coherence is a factor that can be used to evaluate relative correctness.

                    1.2.1.10.6.1.1.2.1.2.1. Con:
                    Most religions contradict themselves in their own texts, so that is a poor measure of comparison.

              1.2.1.10.6.1.1.3. Pro:
              A polytheist must believe that all monotheistic religions are wrong, and a monotheist must believe that all polytheistic religions are wrong.

                1.2.1.10.6.1.1.3.1. Con:
                This is not true. Vaishnava's (worshipers of Lord Vishnu) hold that there is one supreme God and many demo-gods. They focus on the worship of the one supreme God and consider the demi-gods to be servants of God who have some mystical powers. They see people who have polytheistic beliefs (even within the same canon) as missing the point if they don't hold their focus on the one supreme God. In other words polytheists are seen to have a partial truth.

              1.2.1.10.6.1.1.4. Con:
              Some believers hold that those of other faiths are unknowingly worshiping the God of their own faith.

                1.2.1.10.6.1.1.4.1. Con:
                Believers of certain faiths disagree with the nature of gods of other faiths because of what they accept as positive proofs for the nature of their god, rather than simply making a positive statement about the non-existence of the others' god.

                1.2.1.10.6.1.1.4.2. Con:
                The testimony of men can disagree on the full nature of a god which they believe they have witnessed holds more weight on the argument for that god's existence than any number of men who simply say that they saw nothing yet.

              1.2.1.10.6.1.1.5. Con:
              Atheism is rejected by people of almost all other faiths and beliefs. Thus, Atheism is rejected by more people, throughout history, than any other faith.

                1.2.1.10.6.1.1.5.1. Con:
                This is true but does not contradict the parent.

              1.2.1.10.6.1.1.6. Con:
              The strong, nearly universal debate about the nature of a thing, tends to more confirm the existence of that thing in some form than to confirm that it does not exist. It implies at the very least that there are many people who suppose they have a reason for that belief.

              1.2.1.10.6.1.1.7. Con:
              The fact that many people believe something says nothing about the truth value of that thing. To presuppose so is the fallacy of argumentum ad populum [448].

                1.2.1.10.6.1.1.7.1. Pro:
                The Meme hypothesis [449] is a more plausible explanation for the propagation of the God concept than his truthful existence.

            1.2.1.10.6.1.2. Pro:
            Believers of one faith, just like atheists, have no way of proving a negative, unless blatant contradictions are made in specific faiths (e.g. the world will end and it doesn't..)

              1.2.1.10.6.1.2.1. Pro:
              It is impossible to prove that there is no deist God who created the world and then turned their back on it.

                1.2.1.10.6.1.2.1.1. Con:
                A deist God could be proven wrong by proving a theist God to exist. If a God who has loving relationships with us livings entities exists then this can be proven by the experience of such a relationship.

              1.2.1.10.6.1.2.2. Pro:
              It is impossible to prove that there are no fairies.

              1.2.1.10.6.1.2.3. Con:
              A specific failed claim does not invalidate the entire basis of a faith. It is possible that those making the claim (i.e. that the world would end in 1912) were mistaken. The rest of the claims of the faith must be evaluated on their own terms.

            1.2.1.10.6.1.3. Con:
            The evidence in favor of different religions differs wildly. Thus, there is reason to believe one religion is correct and the others are wrong.

              1.2.1.10.6.1.3.1. Pro:
              Religions that have been present for a longer period of time have tradition on their side, which newer religions lack.

                1.2.1.10.6.1.3.1.1. Con:
                Tradition carries no weight in arguments, as something being assumed in the past is not sufficient reason to believe it is true. Neither is the fact that something was done in the past evidence that it is the best option. In fact, history is littered with examples of erroneous traditions.

                  1.2.1.10.6.1.3.1.1.1. Con:
                  It can be true that "something being assumed in the past is not sufficient reason to believe it is true," while at the same time being also true that "tradition carries weight in arguments."
                  
                  This is because though tradition is not a sufficient reason for belief, it can be an important part of a set of reasons, and often is a necessary condition for belief.

                    1.2.1.10.6.1.3.1.1.1.1. Con:
                    If there are a set of reasons something was believed in the past, the reasons themselves should be presented, instead of the fact that they were believed in the past.

                1.2.1.10.6.1.3.1.2. Con:
                Human societies had the tradition of not granting people equal rights, but the West abandoned that practice as being wrong. Thus, something being a tradition is thus not of importance.

              1.2.1.10.6.1.3.2. Con:
              Difference in the strength of the evidence is reason to believe that some are more likely than others to be true, if at least one religion is true. It is not reason enough to go the further steps to believe one specific religion is in fact true.

              1.2.1.10.6.1.3.3. Con:
              This is merely to punt to something beyond religious experience, making the argument from religious experience itself moot.

              1.2.1.10.6.1.3.4. Pro:
              If a true God would not allow his religion to die, then it is necessarily the case that all the myriad pagan religions which have died off are false, and one of the currently existent religions must be true.

                1.2.1.10.6.1.3.4.1. Con:
                There is no reason for us to belive that a true God would not allow his religion to die and, as it stands, it is a mere speculation.

                  1.2.1.10.6.1.3.4.1.1. Pro:
                  Most religions have a "free will" notion which would not be possible if God "would not allow" his religion to die as that would be violation of the free will.

            1.2.1.10.6.1.4. Con:
            Even if the evidence or source of authority of most religions were questionable, that doesn't affect classical theism [450], since it isn't a religion but a philosophical view.

            1.2.1.10.6.1.5. Con:
            As a believer of Atheism, one must believe that his belief or religion is right while all the other contradicting religions and beliefs are wrong. And yet, it lacks any evidence, not even having individual experiences nor ancient texts which some of the other religions can suggest as proof of validity.

              1.2.1.10.6.1.5.1. Pro:
              A belief in Atheism, unlike weak agnosticism, is a positive belief in the non-existence of a thing. As such, it is a belief about a god similar to how Theists have beliefs about a god.

              1.2.1.10.6.1.5.2. Pro:
              A belief in a god is a part of a larger world view, rather than an idea that stands on its own. It answers questions about the meaning of existence, the purpose of our actions, the cause of physical phenomenon, and other questions necessary to functioning well as a human. Removing that single belief does not remove the need for the larger system. Such a system would be a religion, whether Atheist or Theist, formalized or unspoken.

            1.2.1.10.6.1.6. Con:
            Saying that the evidence for different religions is similar because they all use individual experiences and/or texts as evidence is a critique of the type of evidence, not the content. It is similar to saying that because witnesses are called to testify in trial, both the plaintiff and defendant have the same evidence. What remains is to assess an individual religion's evidential claims.

            1.2.1.10.6.1.7. Con:
            Truth is, by definition, exclusive. If one claim is true, an infinite number of contradictory claims are necessarily false.

            1.2.1.10.6.1.8. Con:
            It is important to differentiate the existence of something (a God in this case) and the beliefs of a given doctrine (in this case, religion). Religion is in fact only a theoretical approach to the idea of God, but that people may have a wrong idea of something does not mean it does not exist.

          1.2.1.10.6.2. Con:
          The burden of proof to disprove the existence of lesser deities has not been met.

          1.2.1.10.6.3. Con:
          It could be that along with God existing many less powerful entities also exist. These entities could function as God's engineers overseeing the operation of the natural forces much the same as how engineers in a factory over see operation of machinery and plant equipment.

          1.2.1.10.6.4. Con:
          Even if these lesser deities do not exist, all it shows is that some people are capable of being deluded, something which is already well known fact. It does not prove that all people are deluded all the time about if they believe in anything supernatural.

          1.2.1.10.6.5. Con:
          "If all other gods are mythological and created by man, then likely all gods are," is an unwarranted conclusion. There are many plausible explanations. For example, there may only be one God.

        1.2.1.10.7. Con:
        Popular consensus is not a necessary nor sufficient means of arriving at truth (e.g. whether a claim conforms with reality).

          1.2.1.10.7.1. Pro:
          Disagreements about the definition of something is hardly evidence that something doesn't exist.

            1.2.1.10.7.1.1. Pro:
            People disagree on definitions all the time. It does not follow that the object being defined does not exist.

              1.2.1.10.7.1.1.1. Pro:
              People disagree on what defines marriage, and yet no-one would deny that it exists.

            1.2.1.10.7.1.2. Con:
            Some of the definitions are mutually exclusive, so it is not possible for God to exist according to all definitions.

              1.2.1.10.7.1.2.1. Con:
              It isn't necessary for God to exist according to all definitions.

                1.2.1.10.7.1.2.1.1. Con:
                If there are multiple definitions and only a small part of them are true (and we don't know which part), then the term is ill-defined. This means we cannot use the term 'God' in well-formed sentences, since we don't know what 'God' is.

                  1.2.1.10.7.1.2.1.1.1. Con:
                  Neither an entity nor it's definition is affected by our knowledge (or lack thereof) of either. Our incomplete knowledge invalidates neither the entity, or the proper definition of the entity.

                1.2.1.10.7.1.2.1.2. Pro:
                Some "definitions" may simply be wrong or inaccurate.  In such cases, it is the definition, not the object, that should be discarded.

              1.2.1.10.7.1.2.2. Con:
              This poses no real argument against God existing because it is true of everything. Incoherent definitions could be concocted for anything.

            1.2.1.10.7.1.3. Pro:
            There are many competing interpretations of quantum mechanics [451], but the fact that only one of them can be entirely right doesn't mean that we are forced to reject all of them, or to reject quantum theory itself.

              1.2.1.10.7.1.3.1. Con:
              The different interpretations of QM make the same predictions about what we'd observe in the world. The same cannot be said of religions.

            1.2.1.10.7.1.4. Con:
            We cannot establish a test for or against a claim without first accepting the definitions.

              1.2.1.10.7.1.4.1. Con:
              If God exists, then it would only seem logical that God could never be defined for he is Alpha and is Omega therefore he is, but also isn't from a philosophical point of view. It takes a whole lifespan in order for a certain individual to define himself, therefore God is self explanatory because it takes the entirety of creation to explain Himself.

            1.2.1.10.7.1.5. Pro:
            The versions of God are human approximations of a being more vast than the people writing the stories. Since they're human perspectives, contradictions are almost inevitable. For someone reading about it... Put it this way. Imagine a lit candle in the centre of a room, surrounded by a huge number of curved and bent and flat and twisted mirrors. If you had to draw a picture of the candle using only the reflections, it would almost have to be a composite, and dependent on where you were standing.

            1.2.1.10.7.1.6. Pro:
            The object may seem different to all observers but is fundamentally the same object. This is the nature of truth and perhaps the reason we have so many religions.

              1.2.1.10.7.1.6.1. Pro:
              Religions may all contain elements of truth and non-truth. It does not follow from this that there is no collection of religious propositions that correspond with reality.

          1.2.1.10.7.2. Pro:
          There are conflicting views and definitions on Quantum Theory, but still all of them believe the equations to be true.

        1.2.1.10.8. Pro:
        If there were one true God, they would pass down the definitive knowledge of who they were to the exclusion of all others.

          1.2.1.10.8.1. Con:
          It is not reasonable to claim to know what an all powerful, all knowing entity would do.

            1.2.1.10.8.1.1. Con:
            If, it is unreasonable to claim to know what an all powerful, all knowing entity would do. Then it logically follows that it is not reasonable to claim that the Bible, or any other text, conveys the intention of such a being.

          1.2.1.10.8.2. Pro:
          The Biblical God passed down the definitive definition of who He was in the Bible, and asked for exclusive worship. Exodus 20:1-4 [452]

            1.2.1.10.8.2.1. Pro:
            If there were only one true God, and it was the God of the bible, he has passed down that knowledge of who he is multiple times throughout the scripture.  Jesus Christ was a perfect example of what God was like since it is written that the son and the Father are one.

        1.2.1.10.9. Con:
        There is more agreement than disagreement among world religions.

          1.2.1.10.9.1. Pro:
          Even if not all religions align, god-like figures are shown throughout most religions

            1.2.1.10.9.1.1. Con:
            Recurrence of a concept across civilizations does not prove the veracity of this concept.

          1.2.1.10.9.2. Pro:
          The fact that people who disagree strongly about the nature of God, particularly across different cultures and histories which agree on very little, can still agree on the existence of God tends to provide more evidence for the existence of God than against it.

            1.2.1.10.9.2.1. Pro:
            In science, a lot of knowledge is based on data that repeats over and over. The repetition of similar ideas and images from religions that have no connection to each other is common. Therefore, there must be some sort of being that is omnipresent into our reality.

              1.2.1.10.9.2.1.1. Con:
              Just like languages borrow words from each other, many religions borrow concepts from older or concurrent religions and mythology. This can explain why ideas are sometimes repeated without necessarily being true.

                1.2.1.10.9.2.1.1.1. Pro:
                The story of Noah's Ark borrows heavily from the Epic of Gilgamesh [453].

              1.2.1.10.9.2.1.2. Con:
              This data could just as easily support a claim about humanity itself and a psychological impulse to explain the unknown.

                1.2.1.10.9.2.1.2.1. Pro:
                That psychological impulse is, in other words, "innate cognitive bias to commit false-positive errors rather than false-negative errors" (Satoshi [454]).

            1.2.1.10.9.2.2. Con:
            Agreeing on the existence of gods of strongly distinct natures only provide an evidence that God is not a unified concept.

              1.2.1.10.9.2.2.1. Con:
              It is perfectly coherent to believe that most religions simply have an incomplete or different experience or understanding of the same God, so it's not necessary to reject every doctrine of their belief or declare that they're entirely wrong. This belief is called inclusivism [455].

                1.2.1.10.9.2.2.1.1. Pro:
                Prior to modern archeology, many cultures discovered dinosaur bones and called them dragons. The fact that they were wrong about many of the attributes of dinosaurs doesn't mean we have to completely reject their experience of fossils.

                1.2.1.10.9.2.2.1.2. Con:
                That is effectively stating that either polytheists or monotheists are wrong, as to why, is irrelevant. Both cannot be right at the same time.

                1.2.1.10.9.2.2.1.4. Pro:
                God may have revealed Himself in different ways to suit different cultures, and to help them with their specific spiritual journey.

                  1.2.1.10.9.2.2.1.4.1. Con:
                  A god that reveals himself in such ways as to support contradictory conceptions of god would be making himself seem incompatibly different to different people. This constitutes deception and thus wouldn't be something a good and loving God would do.

                  1.2.1.10.9.2.2.1.4.2. Pro:
                  That would in fact be what a God who was good as defined by the classical definition would do. We know that problems are very different and require different approaches and solutions.

                1.2.1.10.9.2.2.1.5. Con:
                By saying many/all religions have a flawed/incomplete/different understanding of the same god it brings humanity no closer to understanding God.

              1.2.1.10.9.2.2.2. Con:
              "Agreeing on the existence of gods" is only proof of individual choices. In other words, this is only proof of humanity's free will and the fact that people may choose what to believe in. This is not "evidence". This is "belief" and people choose their own beliefs without proving anything else then their own possibility of choosing what to believe.

            1.2.1.10.9.2.3. Pro:
            Perhaps each of these religions is partially correct, some of them more correct than others but none of them absolutely correct. Those accounts which are common among all religions can be thought to be very likely true.

              1.2.1.10.9.2.3.1. Con:
              If God could communicate truth there would be no reason to have much difference at all between religious claims. Even supposing that at some point that truth got distorted, God could still correct us. Therefore, people having to compare religions and decide what comes (or does not come) from God is evidence that there is no God that communicates.

                1.2.1.10.9.2.3.1.1. Con:
                Communication is dependent on both the sender and the receiver. The existence of a perfect sender does not imply perfect communication when sending to an imperfect receiver.

                  1.2.1.10.9.2.3.1.1.1. Con:
                  The communicating is not just sending information, it includes the reception of information. The existence of such a perfect sender would certainly imply better transmission and reception than wildly inconsistent revelations.

                    1.2.1.10.9.2.3.1.1.1.1. Pro:
                    If done today would imply a perfectly received message, which would be recorded and passed on without relevant change, as is the case with any minimally competent youtuber.

              1.2.1.10.9.2.3.2. Con:
              If God could communicate He could also correct people. People having to compare religions and decide that comes from God makes it unlikely that there is any God communicating.

                1.2.1.10.9.2.3.2.1. Con:
                The conclusion doesn't follow from the premise; parents are often ignored by children who simply do not want to be corrected.

                1.2.1.10.9.2.3.2.2. Con:
                Those holding this position must show that God would want to "correct people" in the precise way that they have in mind. Perhaps God does correct persons, but in a different manner. 
                
                For instance, Christianity holds that God has given and preserved His word in the Bible, and that scripture is available to correct us. Hindus adherents would hold that Karma serves as a corrective or retributive force.

            1.2.1.10.9.2.4. Con:
            For this to be true, you need first to define God. The term is highly subjective and interpreted differently by everyone. If I say God is a teapot and you say God is a prime number divisible by 6, then obviously my God exists and your doesn't, which says nothing about some universal definition of God.

            1.2.1.10.9.2.5. Con:
            Belief in a thing is not evidence of the thing's existence.

            1.2.1.10.9.2.6. Pro:
            Many religions that describe God with different natures may be looking at different beings.  For example most Monotheistic religions see a creator God, while the polytheistic religions describe spirits of powers, much like the Angels and Demons are described in Monotheistic religions.  Individual reported experiences could be true but mis-understood.

          1.2.1.10.9.3. Pro:
          By simply following the common [456] moral code, or the law of reciprocity [457], one can attain salvation (or in religions that believe in reincarnation, be closer to attaining it.)

          1.2.1.10.9.4. Con:
          This is patently false, hinduism, buddism, islam, christianity, paganism, fundamentally have different 'truths' including, who is god, how many gods there are, if they have competing messages and intents, if they are tangible. Go back further and you even have gods which did not create the world or universe. If the fundamentals disagree it cannot be claimed that there is more agreement than disagreement.

            1.2.1.10.9.4.1. Con:
            All monotheist traditions have the same God. They have the same essential philosophical description of God. The differences are largely in names and details only.

              1.2.1.10.9.4.1.1. Pro:
              The seeming irreconcilable disagreements among Christianity, bhakti yoga and Islam to name a few is a result of immature, fanatical and unphilosophical members of each camp.

              1.2.1.10.9.4.1.2. Con:
              There are fundamental theological differences between the main abrahamic religions, which makes them difficult to reconcile.

                1.2.1.10.9.4.1.2.1. Con:
                The perception of fundamental differences is the result of poor hermeneutics and fanatical ideas.

              1.2.1.10.9.4.1.3. Pro:
              God is defined by all these traditions as the goal of life and the object for our love.

              1.2.1.10.9.4.1.4. Pro:
              God is defined by all these traditions as the creator. There can be only one creator and this common description narrows down who they are referring to to the same guy.

                1.2.1.10.9.4.1.4.1. Pro:
                It's like saying the artist who did this painting or the chef cooked this meal. People may have various ideas about the artist, some of them more accurate than others, but they are all referring to the same person..

              1.2.1.10.9.4.1.5. Pro:
              Historical elements of the various religions can be expected to differ. The agreement has to be found in the philosophy. For example Christians teach that Jesus appeared and performed various acts. Bhagavad GIta teaches that Krishna appeared and spoke to Arjuna. If we look at the historical elements we will find disagreement but if we look at the philosophy we will find a lot in common. Both are monotheistic and teach that we can have a personal loving relationship with God.

          1.2.1.10.9.5. Con:
          "More agreement than disagreement" is vague and poorly-defined, and a study could be made to return the desired result either way by tailoring how the amount of agreement/disagreement is to be quantified.

          1.2.1.10.9.6. Pro:
          Monotheism is central to all the major world religions with the exception of Buddhism.

            1.2.1.10.9.6.1. Con:
            Religions become "major world religions" due to historically contingent facts - e.g. European colonialism making Christianity dominant over large swaths of the globe. It is not clear that these make religions more worthy of note than minor or dead religions, such as Aztec paganism.

              1.2.1.10.9.6.1.1. Con:
              A study of the history of religions reveals that philosophical elements of a religion effects its success.

            1.2.1.10.9.6.2. Pro:
            The highest teachings in the Hindu tradition [458] are monotheistic and center around love for God

              1.2.1.10.9.6.2.1. Pro:
              Followers of the Vaishnava tradition have great respect for profits from other traditions such as Jesus and Mohamed, and see commonality in the core teaching that the goal of human life is to develop love for God.

              1.2.1.10.9.6.2.2. Pro:
              The modern impersonalist form of Hinduism which is in vogue is an off shoot of the Vaishnava tradition as explained in the above linked lectures series

            1.2.1.10.9.6.3. Pro:
            Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Vaishnavism and Sikhism all teach that the goal of life to to Develop our love for God.

      Testimonial evidence is the chief tool of the apostles.

        The Apostles were eye witnesses to miracles, which are evidence that God exists.

          1.2.1.11.1.1. Pro:
          There are many accounts [459] of the Apostles witnessing miracles.

            1.2.1.11.1.1.1. Con:
            Accounts claiming that the apostles witnessed miracles is not evidence for the existence of a god.

          1.2.1.11.1.2. Con:
          If "miracle" is defined as "an observed phenomenon which is not explained by current knowledge and seems to violate the laws of nature", then miracles are not evidence that a God exists.

            1.2.1.11.1.2.1. Pro:
            Shows made by magicians seem to violate the laws of nature, however, they are known to use "tricks" to give the appearance of violating the laws of nature, and nothing supernatural actually happens. Spectators only "believe" the shows by willing suspension of disbelief [460], for entertainment purposes.

              1.2.1.11.1.2.1.1. Pro:
              While spectators usually cannot explain what they have seen, they should not come to the conclusion that the magician has supernatural or divine powers.

          1.2.1.11.1.3. Con:
          Even when assuming that what they described matches and what they witnessed and that they indeed witnessed real miracles, this wouldn't be evidence God exists. Mere miracles do not point to this explanation in specific – it would rather point towards extraterrestrials or ET-origin beings deploying advanced technology that to humans appears indistinguishable from magic [461].

          1.2.1.11.1.4. Con:
          We cannot asses how reliable the Apostles themselves are. People tell lies, or just are wrong sometimes, and that might be the case for them too.

            1.2.1.11.1.4.1. Pro:
            Examples include that they had hallucinations, were pressured into lying, unknowingly were under the influence of psychoactive chemicals, had illusions, were misunderstood over time, or misinterpreted events.

          1.2.1.11.1.5. Con:
          Attempting to prove existence by means of “evidence” found within the pages of questionable texts is a circular argument that requires a leap of faith.

        1.2.1.11.2. Con:
        Witness testimony is the lowest form of evidence, both in the court room and in scientific inquiry. In fact, the reliance on testimony is one of the major weaknesses of the notion that God exists.

        1.2.1.11.3. Con:
        -> See 1.2.1.8.5.

      1.2.1.12. Pro:
      Hinduism supports the existence of God.

        1.2.1.12.1. Pro:
        The vedic scriptures teach monotheism, that Krishna [462] is the Supreme personality of Godhead [463].

          1.2.1.12.1.1. Pro:
          The other personalities mentioned are demi-gods, empowered personalities who work like engineers in God's creation, something like the idea of angels in Christianity.

          1.2.1.12.1.2. Pro:
          Some of the other personalities are Krishna Himself exhibitting different features of His personality much like a court judge has one personality he shows at work and another he shows at home with his kids climbing on him.

          1.2.1.12.1.3. Pro:
          The Tattva Sandardba of Jiva Goswami establishes the Srimad Bhagavatam as the highest authority in the Vedas and that the Srimad Bhagavatam teaches pure devotion to Sri Krishna.

          1.2.1.12.1.4. Pro:
          The word Krishna means all-attractive one. This name is therefore no sectarian name but is a very fitting name for the supereme personality of Godhead.

          1.2.1.12.1.5. Con:
          That scriptures describe what a deity is like does not itself prove that such a deity exists.

        1.2.1.12.2. Con:
        Because Hinduism is a pantheistic or panentheistic belief system, this is not possible.

          1.2.1.12.2.1. Pro:
          God in this discussion is defined to be the God of classical theism, which is a monotheistic God. If Hinduism "proves" the existence of this God, then it would also prove itself to be false... in which case, it could prove nothing.

          1.2.1.12.2.2. Pro:
          If Hinduism proves the existence of it's own concept of God, this would defeat the premise of a monotheistic God, thereby defeating the initial premise of this discussion.

            1.2.1.12.2.2.1. Con:
            The kind of God that Hinduism proves the existence of is a monotheistic God, so the Hindu proof would not defeat the premise in any way.

          1.2.1.12.2.3. Con:
          The Hindu concept of God is not [464] necessarily [465] incompatible with monotheism.

            1.2.1.12.2.3.1. Con:
            Hindu followers disagree.
            
            "To call Hinduism monotheistic or to try to scale it down into the perimeters of western monotheistic religions is misleading and erroneous." -- American Institute of Vedic Studies [466]

              1.2.1.12.2.3.1.1. Con:
              The American Institute of Vedic Studies is not remotely representative of what Hindus believe.

            1.2.1.12.2.3.2. Con:
            While some Hindu followers would agree with the above ("But in reality Hinduism is monotheistic. [467]" --- Swami Radhanandaji), even those followers would affirm the existence of other "gods" emanating out of the Brahaman. This is incompatible with monotheism.

            1.2.1.12.2.3.3. Pro:
            "Worship practices in Hinduism are as diverse as its traditions, and a Hindu can choose [468] to be polytheistic, pantheistic, monotheistic, monistic, agnostic, atheistic, or humanist."

          1.2.1.12.2.4. Pro:
          From the link on the root claim [469]: "Classical theism is a form of theism in which God is characterized as the absolutely metaphysically ultimate being, in contrast to other conceptions such as pantheism, panentheism, polytheism and process theism."

          1.2.1.12.2.5. Con:
          Hinduism is the belief of a single God of many faces

    1.2.2. Con:
    Belief based evidence is only considered by worshippers as valid where it lends support to their own religion; this is an example of relativist fallacy [470].

      1.2.2.1. Pro:
      Any belief based claim of evidence can be used to support any belief based proposition such as polytheism.

        1.2.2.1.1. Con:
        Many examples of Polytheistic religions show the Gods often being in conflict with one another. This may infer that creation by a committee of gods would be problematic and less likely to succeed than creation by a single entity.

          1.2.2.1.1.1. Pro:
          Multiple people with equal power sometimes reach an impasse. A disagreement among gods would result in chaos. This is not consistent with the world we observe which is ordered and predictable.

            1.2.2.1.1.1.1. Con:
            A disagreement between gods need not result in chaos, as beings of equal power could instead reach an impasse. Indeed, everywhere in nature, we see predators optimised to catch prey that are in turn optimised to not be caught. If the order in nature came from a divine source, this would seem a clear example of such an impasse; the god of rabbits and the god of foxes disagree about whether foxes should be able to catch rabbits, and their designs express this conflict.

        1.2.2.1.2. Pro:
        The revelation experienced by worshippers of polytheistic religions would support the existince of multiple Gods, which is a direct contradiction of the claim that the same experience supports the existence of one God only.

      1.2.2.2. Pro:
      If belief based evidence were considered infallible, then there would not be differences in the teachings of the Abrahamic religions.

        1.2.2.2.1. Pro:
        Those of the Jewish faith do not recognise the "faithful practices, religious experiences and testimony" of the Christian and Islamic prophet Jesus and the followers of his founded religion, Christianity.

        1.2.2.2.2. Pro:
        Islamic prophet Muhammad's religious experiences are not afforded the same consideration by Christians as that of their religion's founder.

          1.2.2.2.2.1. Pro:
          Christians do not recognise the revelation received by the Islamic prophet Muhammad as he disbelieved the claim that Jesus was the son of God/Allah.

      1.2.2.3. Con:
      The question, "Does God exist?," is different from the question, "Which God exists?" All theists share the same answer to the first question, so their use of belief-based evidence does not commit the relativist fallacy, which pertains more to the second question.

        1.2.2.3.1. Con:
        If the question of "Which God exists?" can be answered by refusing to accept belief based evidence (to avoid committing the relativist fallacy) all Gods are eliminated, answering the question of "Does God exist?" with no.

    1.2.3. Con:
    Subjects that experience such divine revelations could actually be experiencing a form of the placebo effect because of their pre-existing belief in God.

      1.2.3.1. Con:
      It is possible divine revelations are truthful, but are rejected out of hand by non-believers due to their lack of belief.

    1.2.4. Con:
    Testimonial evidence is not accurate most of the time.

    1.2.5. Con:
    Testimonial evidence is inherently anecdotal [471] and thus is unreliable and of limited value due to it's clear weaknesses.

      1.2.5.1. Pro:
      The same kinds of experiences involving the divine happen with deities other than the Christian God, which undermines the credibility of religious experiences as evidence for any particular deity or religion.

        1.2.5.1.1. Con:
        -> See 1.2.1.10.6.1.3.

        1.2.5.1.2. Pro:
        If all of these experiences are real, then the God of classical theism cannot exist.

        1.2.5.1.3. Con:
        The fact that the belief in God is prevalent, even among groups who refuse to believe or accept any of the other claims from competing groups, tends to add further weight to the belief in God.

          1.2.5.1.3.1. Con:
          Many of the religions referred to are polytheistic rather than monotheistic, and therefore a belief in gods, rather than a belief in God.

          1.2.5.1.3.2. Con:
          The "further weight to believe" is not evidence of existence.  All religions cannot be right at the same time, because their gods and beliefs contradict each other.

        1.2.5.1.4. Con:
        The differences between deities experienced in revelations are surface-level differences. The same ultimate being is at the root of some, many, or all of them.

        1.2.5.1.5. Con:
        Christianity, which endorses classical Theism, does not claim that God is the only spiritual entity in the universe. Encounters with a spiritual entity do not necessarily mean that such encounters are with God Himself. Therefore, a spiritual encounter with a being who is not God in no way implies that God does not exist.

      1.2.5.2. Pro:
      Anecdotal evidence is prone to cognitive bias [472].

      1.2.5.3. Pro:
      Anecdotal evidence is prone to selective cherry picking [473], potentially for self-serving interests.

      1.2.5.4. Pro:
      Anecdotal evidence is highly prone to confirmation bias. [474]

    1.2.6. Con:
    When such testimonies are more or less exclusively from only millennia or at least hundreds of years ago and are largely ambiguous, that substantially weakens the case for regarding such as credible supportive data or even evidence.

      1.2.6.1. Pro:
      One would expect a God to communicate more unambiguously. Theist religious texts such as the Bible were written long ago and basically not extended since then [475] and religious events such as prophets and notable divine revelations also do not seem to occur anymore.

    1.2.7. Pro:
    The teachings of prophets provide credence to the idea that God exists.

      1.2.7.1. Pro:
      There are prophets who can reform people even if such reform seems unachievable. This wouldn't be possible without divine help.

        1.2.7.1.1. Con:
        If free will exists, then there should be no-one for whom reform is impossible without divine intervention.

        1.2.7.1.2. Con:
        Something that "seems unachievable", but actually happens, shows that it was not as unachievable as that.

        1.2.7.1.3. Con:
        This is an argument from ignorance.

      1.2.7.2. Pro:
      God the Father and Jesus Christ visited Joseph Smith. First Vision [476]

        1.2.7.2.1. Con:
        -> See 1.2.1.1.4.

      1.2.7.3. Con:
      The claim that the aforementioned prophets are endorsed by God lacks confirmation.

      1.2.7.4. Con:
      Prophets often endorse contradictory claims (example: Matthew 5:44 [477] and Koran 2:191 [478]).

        1.2.7.4.1. Pro:
        -> See 1.2.1.7.3.

        1.2.7.4.2. Pro:
        The Quran contains contradictions and inconsistencies. [479]

        1.2.7.4.3. Con:
        It is not surprising to find prophets from two different religions making contradictory claims.

          1.2.7.4.3.1. Con:
          Often the contradictions [480] are [481] within [482] the same religion

          1.2.7.4.3.2. Pro:
          Two prophets from two dissimilar religions worshiping different concepts of God (one or both of which may be false Gods) provide no basis for an expectation of consistency.

            1.2.7.4.3.2.1. Con:
            The fact that different prophets have different views while claiming to have all used the same method indicates that they cannot be trusted.

      1.2.7.5. Con:
      This point is circular within the broader argument, because it essentially makes the claim: “We know how to know God, because God told the prophets and they told us.” If god doesn’t exist, he didn’t tell the prophets anything.

      1.2.7.6. Con:
      No prophet has ever been shown to have specific, precise, and accurate knowledge of the future that cannot be explained by chance or their personal influence.

        1.2.7.6.1. Con:
        Biblically speaking a prophet’s principal role is to be a forthteller [483], not a foreteller.

        1.2.7.6.2. Pro:
        There have been many supposed prophets since the scientific revolution, and so have been many opportunities for these people to prove themselves to be genuine, if they wished.

    1.2.8. Pro:
    Testimonies of experiences involving God are a reliable form of evidence.

      1.2.8.1. Con:
      A religious person claiming that they had a religious experience is not proof of anything other than that person's religiousness.

        1.2.8.1.1. Con:
        This does not provide an explanation for atheists and non-believers who have religious experiences.

          1.2.8.1.1.1. Pro:
          An atheist who has a compelling religious experience would no longer be an atheist, so by this standard no account of personal revelation would be valid no matter how trustworthy or reliable. It's like a flat-earther denying all orbital photographs of the Earth's curve that weren't taken by a fellow flat-earther.

          1.2.8.1.1.2. Pro:
          Some converts to Christianity attribute their conversion to an experience of God that they had (while still a non-believer).

        1.2.8.1.2. Con:
        The above claim is predicated on a bias world view (materialism) which filters evidence (anything indicating a metaphysical reality) according to its bias and then claims there is no evidence to contradict the bias. It's therefore guilty of begging the question.

        1.2.8.1.3. Con:
        If we apply the same principle (personal experience is not evidence) to materialism we run into the same problem as when applied to theism. If personal experience is not evidence then there is no way to prove that the material world exists. Extreme skeptism about human experience has unintended consequences as it devastates any conceivable epistemological foundation.

      1.2.8.2. Con:
      Anecdotal accounts of religious experiences cannot be regarded as credible evidence for the existence of God.

        1.2.8.2.1. Pro:
        -> See 1.2.5.1.

        1.2.8.2.2. Pro:
        Religious people may deliberately lie or be unintentionally mistaken.

        1.2.8.2.3. Pro:
        -> See 1.2.5.2.

        1.2.8.2.4. Pro:
        -> See 1.2.5.3.

        1.2.8.2.5. Pro:
        A testimony is not worth much without supporting tangible or testable evidence.

        1.2.8.2.6. Pro:
        Even if the revelation is truly from God and is properly interpreted by the one receiving revelation, such an experience is personal and only justifies belief for that individual. However, it cannot be used as part of an argument to persuade others who have not had that experience.

          1.2.8.2.6.1. Con:
          If religious experience is the primary mode of an individual's epistemic contact with the divine, then it should be regarded as important subjective evidence in an individual's consideration of God's existence, even if it is not convincing as objective evidence in a debate.

          1.2.8.2.6.2. Con:
          While it's true that the proof is only evident to those who have the eyes to see it or who have had such experiences, what makes it scientific is that anyone can develop their consciousness to be able to see the proof also. Religions offer a process for pleasing God to the point where God reciprocates with the subject and and his existence becomes evident. The same process also elevates the subjects consciousness to be able to recognize such self-evident truths.

            1.2.8.2.6.2.1. Con:
            This is Pascal's wager. People also leave religion for atheism, cults or in many cases, to ensure they do not miss the Superbowl. This suffers from the replication and reproducibility problems as the effects do not hold for all who take Pascal's wager.

        1.2.8.2.7. Pro:
        Anecdotal evidence is the least reliable kind of evidence. This means experiences (in this context with god) have little to no value when it comes to proving whether a proposition (the existance of god) is true or false.

          1.2.8.2.7.1. Pro:
          The fact that memories are faulty [484] means that recollection of experiences can not be trusted at face value, hence the unreliability of anecdotal evidence.

        1.2.8.2.8. Pro:
        Humans report religious experiences and develop religious narratives, including the existence of God, as a result of their painful experiences and hardships. If you alleviate the hardships, there would be no need to attribute success to God.

          1.2.8.2.8.1. Pro:
          It seems God is held responsible for both good & bad tidings when He may not even exist. E.g., a regular church-going friend lost his spouse to death & stopped attending church, blaming God for her death.

          1.2.8.2.8.2. Con:
          Some have reported about God without (or at least before) having any major hardship. King Solomon is one example.

          1.2.8.2.8.3. Pro:
          Losing young children may be the hardest thing to cope with. It is often rationalized by the idea that "God needed another angel" It doesn't make any sense, but the belief could help someone cope with a terrible loss.

          1.2.8.2.8.4. Con:
          Hardships may account for some persons generating belief in God. However, it is improbable that this is the only reason.

        1.2.8.2.9. Pro:
        Anecdotal evidence doesn't provide a quantifiable amount of verifiable information to use as a determination for whether a given claim is true or not true.

          1.2.8.2.9.1. Con:
          Religious experience as such needs an explanation, even if anecdotal. Inference to the best explanation shows that the Christian worldview outstrips any other explanations for all instances of religious belief and unbelief.

            1.2.8.2.9.1.1. Pro:
            The Christian doctrine of the Holy Spirit gives a plausible explanation for the perseverance of Christian belief, even in times of persecution.

            1.2.8.2.9.1.2. Pro:
            The Christian teachings about freedom of the will and divine election give a plausible explanation of Christian belief and unbelievers / heresies.

            1.2.8.2.9.1.3. Pro:
            The Christian doctrines on the existence of a deceiver (Satan) add credibility to explanations on religious diversity, unbelief and heresies.

            1.2.8.2.9.1.4. Pro:
            Christian worldview doctrines are internally logically consistent.

            1.2.8.2.9.1.5. Pro:
            Naturalism, Darwinism and materialism fail to plausibly explain the perseverance of belief in times of persecution.

              1.2.8.2.9.1.5.1. Con:
              The number of people who die before reproducing due to being overly committed to a particular belief is not high enough that evolution should have eliminated any propensity to adopt such beliefs to the point of dying for them, so the persistence of belief in times of persecution is perfectly consistent with evolution.

              1.2.8.2.9.1.5.2. Con:
              That a single specific belief system is actually true fails to explain how those of other belief systems, whether religions or political ideologies, have persisted with such belief in times of persecution.

          1.2.8.2.9.2. Pro:
          If anecdotal evidence were legally enough evidence to convict a person of a crime then it would only take a small group of people making a claim that a crime took place to convict the accused, which would make it easy to unjustly convict people. Thus, anecdotal evidence in favor of the existence of God should be ignored.

            1.2.8.2.9.2.1. Con:
            Saying that the anecdotal evidence for Jesus could not convince in a court of law is simply false since many great legal minds, including Simon Greenleaf [485], suggest otherwise.

          1.2.8.2.9.3. Pro:
          There's no evidence to show that divine experiences are anything other than wishful-thinking, fallacious reasoning, or fraudulent reporting.

            1.2.8.2.9.3.1. Con:
            1. The view that the 5 senses are the only ways people can perceive evidence is unnecessarily limited. 
            2. Well over half of all people in the world believe in God, many of whom claim that they can perceive God in a way that they don't trace to the 5 senses. 
            3. Therefore, it is not irrational to consider the possibility of God's existence and that people may be perceiving God in a way other than through the 5 senses.

              1.2.8.2.9.3.1.1. Con:
              There are more then 5 senses, but there is no reason to believe any of them can sense something divine. The "divine sense" just moves the problem of not having a reason to believe in God to one of not having a reason to believe in the sense of God.

            1.2.8.2.9.3.2. Con:
            The currently accepted standards for science and epistemology may not be adequate to account for true religious experience, even if it were assumed there was such a thing.

          1.2.8.2.9.4. Pro:
          Arguments from personal experience are highly subjective and not verifiable or observable.

            1.2.8.2.9.4.1. Con:
            Personal experience is often held in high regard.

            1.2.8.2.9.4.2. Con:
            To say all personal experience cannot be trusted because of its private nature is a sweeping generalization. Individual reports must be taken into account on a case by case basis.

          1.2.8.2.9.5. Con:
          The possibility of revelation and direct experience gives reason to give some credence to claims, and while not being enough for an external determination is very compelling to the one who experienced it first hand.

            1.2.8.2.9.5.1. Pro:
            Even if the only way for a hypothetical external observer to test this is to cease being an external observer, this is a relevant point to the enquiry (as none of us are truly external).

            1.2.8.2.9.5.2. Con:
            Since we want to know whether God exists in our shared world (reality), rather than in some person's halucinations and mistakes, personal experience is unfit and unreliable for a task that is a prori implausible.

              1.2.8.2.9.5.2.1. Con:
              Because Merriam-Webster includes a definition of "a priori" as "presupposed by experience [486]", it seems that personal experience is precisely the tool required to evaluate a priori assumptions.

          1.2.8.2.9.6. Con:
          Once you analyse all the known points of view of a certain Historical Data from all the dimensions you may now interpret that historical data(i.e.cultural context of the time,human habits of that period, the roots and all known coincidences (i.e. The existence of dinosaurs discovered through bones in different parts of the world) one develops distinct capacities in relation to that certain data. This simply means:You become a master of it and your logic may filter the bias. You become a scholar.

          1.2.8.2.9.7. Con:
          Anecdotal evidence is often used in courts of law, often as a cumulative case, to determine guilt. The case for God has many many numerous anecdotes that can culminate with philosophical thought (which is often also based on physical reality and/or intuitive reasoning about the human experience) and even some scientific findings/proposals (on prayer, the soul).

        1.2.8.2.10. Pro:
        The object of one's faith and the subsequent practices, as well as the context of ones experiences can all be based on provable falsities. Importantly, revelation is necessarily a first person experience and merely hearsay to everyone else.

          1.2.8.2.10.1. Con:
          God is a necessary condition for divine revelation to occur. The statement here seems analogous to saying that reading the newspaper is only proof of the existence of newspapers, and not of the existence of journalists. That would be absurd.

      1.2.8.3. Pro:
      Rejecting this would be like assuming a missing soldier is dead, while ignoring individual reports that he is alive.

        1.2.8.3.1. Con:
        One must have good evidence said soldier existed in the first place, in addition to a lack of evidence for his supposed death and good reason to believe said reports are credible. None of which are present nor sufficient in a testimonial claim of the existence of an all-powerful supernatural being.

        1.2.8.3.2. Con:
        Individual reports that a dead person is alive do occur in the case of famous people like Elvis Presley [487]; seeing as the Christian God is almost as popular as the Beatles [488], one may surmise the same would apply to Him.

        1.2.8.3.3. Con:
        Rejecting this would be like accepting you don't know whether or not a missing soldier is dead, regardless of reports he is alive, because he has not yet been found in either state.

        1.2.8.3.4. Pro:
        Believing a missing soldier is dead means giving up hope. Similarly, discarding hope in the presence of uncertainty is unhelpful, so it is important for people to practice faith and hope in the existence of God.

          1.2.8.3.4.1. Con:
          Giving up hope allows to abandon a false belief and replace it with a true one, which can better allow to improve the world.

          1.2.8.3.4.2. Con:
          This does not substantiate why it would be important for people to practice faith and hope in the existence of God. A globally large population of irreligious people [489] and various [490] surveys and studies [491] show [492] that religion is not necessary and that one can be hopeful, successful and happy without such beliefs. People can also substitute religious doctrine with beliefs that are less false or have much higher likelihoods, while for many doing so is not needed either.

      1.2.8.4. Pro:
      Testimonial evidence is used in courts of law to establish facts beyond reasonable doubt.

        1.2.8.4.1. Con:
        A supernatural claim will not be accepted in court.

        1.2.8.4.2. Con:
        Tangible evidence, or a lack of expected tangible evidence, tends to override testimonial evidence and lends far more to reasonable doubt or a conviction.

        1.2.8.4.3. Con:
        In a court of law testimonial evidence is rarely accepted by itself.

          1.2.8.4.3.1. Pro:
          Testimonial evidence will be rejected when the claim is extraordinary or outside of our normal understanding of physics.

            1.2.8.4.3.1.1. Pro:
            No eyewitness is going to be accepted in a court of law for something like resurrection that would require something like specialist medical expertise.

              1.2.8.4.3.1.1.1. Con:
              Specialists medical experts are not needed to know that crucified men don't come alive.

                1.2.8.4.3.1.1.1.1. Con:
                They might be needed to ascertain whether or not a person was actually dead.

          1.2.8.4.3.2. Con:
          Testimonial evidence is acceptable on its own if there are many independent reliable witnesses, and if the testimony includes facts that can be established objectively.

            1.2.8.4.3.2.1. Con:
            If it is accepted with many other statements, then it isn't on its own.

        1.2.8.4.4. Con:
        This claim is highly country dependent, some court of law will give more value to witness testimony than the other.

      1.2.8.5. Con:
      Testimonial evidence has been already proved to be unreliable. Not only people can lie but also hallucinate, have memory distortion etc. Testimonials are far from being scientific evidence.

        1.2.8.5.1. Pro:
        Moses is said to have spoken to God through a burning bush, yet there are many plants that have hallucinogenic [493] effects when burned.

        1.2.8.5.2. Pro:
        Eyewitness accounts are incredibly unreliable. 1 [494] 2 [495] 3 [496]

        1.2.8.5.3. Pro:
        Using written stories that were originally oral tradition [497] as evidence is the equivalent of 'hearsay' in a court setting.

          1.2.8.5.3.1. Pro:
          The Old Testament was written around 1000 -- 750 BC, and theologians have determined Genesis to be around 10,000 years ago for the time to work. That means 7,000 years of oral tradition.

          1.2.8.5.3.2. Pro:
          There were flood stories predating the writing of Noah that had a number of similarities. Noah was likely borrowed and re-adapted.

          1.2.8.5.3.3. Pro:
          The authors of the Bible collected oral tales and pieced them together. Thus, it is essentially a second-hand account, which is not admissible as evidence [498].

          1.2.8.5.3.4. Con:
          Historical evidence is not held to the same standard as legal evidence.

            1.2.8.5.3.4.1. Con:
            Either way, hundreds and hundreds of generations passing a story forward diminishes its accuracy.

        1.2.8.5.4. Pro:
        The game / experiment Chinese Whispers [499] easily show how unreliable a testimony can be.

        1.2.8.5.5. Pro:
        A 1999 U.S. Department of Justice [500] panel claimed that, "Like trace evidence, eyewitness evidence can be contaminated, lost, destroyed or otherwise made to produce results that can lead to an incorrect reconstruction [of events]."

        1.2.8.5.6. Con:
        In this specific case, which I assume is testimonies about the life of Jesus, hundreds of people supposedly saw him. Therefore there should be hundreds of contradictory testimonies, which is not the case.

          1.2.8.5.6.1. Con:
          They could have gotten their information at the same source.

          1.2.8.5.6.2. Con:
          Testimonials of various miracles performed by Jesus would certainly generate contemporary accounts which simply do not exist.

            1.2.8.5.6.2.1. Pro:
            Matthew 27:50 [501] details that upon the death of Jesus the earth shaking, tombing breaking open and the bodies of holy people returned to life. That this extraordinary series of events does not appear to have been recorded by any contemporary record, or even the other gospels defies credulity.

      1.2.8.6. Con:
      Testimonial evidence supports the existence of mythical creatures such as Santa Claus and Big Foot.

        1.2.8.6.1. Pro:
        Accepting this would be like assuming fairies exist because people claim they've had a lost tooth replaced with money by the tooth fairy at night.

        1.2.8.6.2. Con:
        Testimonies about Jesus talk about him living a very public life and interacting with many thousands of people, so it would have been easy for people to disregard the testimonies at the time because they would have obviously been false.

    1.2.9. Con:
    To call any testimonial evidence "divine revelations" assumes the existence of a divine agent, which begs the question.

      1.2.9.1. Con:
      Just as with the use of assumptions in logic, the existence of the divine can be assumed in order to build on the argument with additional evidence and reasoning.

        1.2.9.1.1. Con:
        A logical assumption is used to explore ideas, not to prove them. In any kind of reasoning, assuming something to be true in order to prove itself lacks validity and persuasiveness.

    1.2.10. Con:
    Contradictory experiences are commonly reported by adherents of different belief systems.

      1.2.10.1. Pro:
      People have had similar experiences regarding e.g. pagan gods and nature spirits, so unless we accept that all of these exist we cannot use this as proof of God's existence.

        1.2.10.1.1. Con:
        -> See 1.2.1.10.6.1.3.

        1.2.10.1.2. Pro:
        Such experiences do not necessarily validate God specifically. They could validate any of numerous other things. The individual might only interpret the experience as religious as a result of confirmation bias.

          1.2.10.1.2.1. Con:
          Lack of validation is no indication of the opposite. Even the scientific method is not interested in validation, only falsification and partial support, which is offered by personal religious experiences.

            1.2.10.1.2.1.1. Con:
            The scientific method definitely cares about validation precisely because so many scientific observations are of effects with only statistical results.   The more independent trials validating the result the more unlikely the negative is. What you are observing is a publication bias caused by journals so aren't interested in publishing results like "Yes, relativistic effects have been demonstrated yet again", etc.

      1.2.10.2. Pro:
      Some people have religious experiences of the absence of God. If the same standard applies in these cases, these would serve as evidence for atheism.

        1.2.10.2.1. Con:
        It is likely that these people's preconceived biases and lack of faith inform their experiences of the absence of God.

      1.2.10.3. Con:
      There are experiential arguments for the existence of God as a universal power. Those reports come from some practitioners of Yoga, Meditation, and other spiritual practices. Even though these reports are not yet scientifically verified, the accounts are nearly identical.

        1.2.10.3.1. Con:
        The account of a report that is not scientifically verified cannot afford a scientific impact.

          1.2.10.3.1.1. Con:
          The basis of empirical science rests on the assumption that only things which can be empirically verified can be taken with any certainty to be true. This assumption is circular in nature because there is no empirical way to back up this assumption.

        1.2.10.3.2. Con:
        The practices of yoga and meditation do not require a belief in a god to be effective. Since a god is not common in all of these practices, it is not required to get the effects.

          1.2.10.3.2.1. Con:
          The claim is that many people all over the world have an experience of God. If some practice yoga and are atheists this is not relevant. Someone could use a microwave and not believe in radiation. Their food will still cook.

          1.2.10.3.2.2. Con:
          The practice of yoga was originally for the purpose of developing the ability to sit for long periods to meditate on God. The practices have many benefits for the body and mind which are useful for things other than meditating.

          1.2.10.3.2.3. Con:
          Atheistic practitioners of Yoga are only getting a shadow of the benefits to be had from Yoga. There are higher benefits to be had, namely developing Love for God, directly perceiving God, and loosing attraction for the dualistic pleasures of this world.

          1.2.10.3.2.4. Con:
          Bhakti Yoga provides a method to developing love of God with a process to do so and results that can be measured.

            1.2.10.3.2.4.1. Pro:
            By chanting Hare Krishna maha mantra repeatedly while avoiding sinful activity ones heart becomes pure and one gradually realizes pure love for God.

        1.2.10.3.3. Pro:
        The advanced and mature practitioners of religious/spiritual faiths from all over the world while disagreeing on details all see the same principles.

          1.2.10.3.3.1. Con:
          The experience is reproducible. The source of the experience is pure speculation. While the subjective experience is commonly felt across the world, the speculation of what causes it varies widely and tends to match preconceived notions taught by local tradition. Those interpretations contradict each other to such a great degree that one can conclude that there must not be universal source for the experience. If it was divine, then all experiencers would have the same explanation.

        1.2.10.3.4. Con:
        The experience of Yoga, Meditation, etc can be easily explained by modern neurology [502] as not being from God. The experiencer must interpret the subjective experience. Some interpret it as being from God, but that does not make it so. A person's interpretation will depend on their beliefs. So the argument is circular: a person who believes that Yoga experiences come from God, will interpret it as being from God. But it is not evidence of anything.

      1.2.10.4. Pro:
      People of all religions claim to have had religious experiences that pertain to their belief systems. This suggests that religious experiences are psychological or social phenomena, rather than genuine experiences of a particular god.

        1.2.10.4.1. Pro:
        Evangelical Christians claim to have experienced the presence of Jesus. Catholics claim to have have experienced the Virgin Mary or a saint. Muslims claim to have had a religious experience with Allah. Buddhists with Buddha and Hindus with Krishna or another deity and so on and so on.

        1.2.10.4.2. Con:
        People have also reported [503] having religious experiences associated with other belief systems that are not their own, and later converted to the religion in question.

    1.2.11. Con:
    Psychological and sociological explanations question the authenticity of religious beliefs and experiences reported by followers.

      1.2.11.1. Con:
      The psychology of a subject or their social surroundings do not affect the ontology of God.

      1.2.11.2. Con:
      Certain human behaviors and experiences can be explained only by the existence of God.

        1.2.11.2.1. Con:
        Believers automatically attribute things to God because they experience their life through that perspective. Subjective experience isn't reliable, trustworthy evidence.

          1.2.11.2.1.1. Con:
          Believers in Naturalism also filter their experiences through their world view. They automatically attribute experiences to matter. The accusation of bias can just as readily be leveled at skeptics rendering it a meaningless claim.

          1.2.11.2.1.2. Con:
          All experiences are an aggregate composed of subjective experiences. If subjective experiences have no epistemological value then a collection of subjective experiences which we call objective experiences also has no value.

        1.2.11.2.2. Pro:
        Christian martyrs wouldn't have gone as far as sacrificing their lives if they didn't genuinely believe in the existence of God. Thus, Christian martyrdom [504] is proof that God exists.

          1.2.11.2.2.1. Pro:
          Many of the supposed eyewitnesses to the resurrected body went on to be martyred for their faith.

            1.2.11.2.2.1.1. Pro:
            If the witnesses were lying or doubtful about the resurrection, they could have saved their lives by simply denying it happened, yet multiple people were willing to die for their beliefs.

            1.2.11.2.2.1.2. Con:
            There are no confirmed [505] "eye-witnesses" to the resurrection of Jesus.

            1.2.11.2.2.1.3. Pro:
            There are in fact confirmed [506] witnesses [507] of the resurrection [508] of Jesus [509] in modern [510] day times and who died [511] with that testimony.

              1.2.11.2.2.1.3.1. Pro:
              The death [512] for a testimony indicates that one is willing [513] to give their life for what they learned [514] which shows the importance [515] of the knowledge [516] even over their own lives and their eternal [517] perspective [518] than deny what they know. [519]

              1.2.11.2.2.1.3.2. Pro:
              Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery recorded seeing the resurrected Jesus Christ [520] .

                1.2.11.2.2.1.3.2.1. Pro:
                Joseph Smith was martyred [521] for the restorative work Christ asked him to complete, thus sealing his testimony of the resurrected Christ like those in ancient times.

            1.2.11.2.2.1.4. Pro:
            Some of the scrolls preserve letters of Peter, who claimed to be an eyewhitness of the resurrection and died for his faith.

              1.2.11.2.2.1.4.1. Con:
              People often present themselves as witnesses to convince people. It is a form of rhetoric that is viewable throughout. Some even believe Socrates was a shared character to give value to morals and ideas of a group. We have many of these today, and no shortage of new ones appearing.

          1.2.11.2.2.2. Con:
          If martyrdom is to be considered evidence of truth, then all faiths (monotheistic, polytheistic or cult based) who have martyrs would be on equal footing.

            1.2.11.2.2.2.1. Pro:
            Buddhist monks lit themselves on fire, while Ättestupa took place by Vikings to avoid death by old age. Very contradictory versions of gods have people sacrificing themselves for their beliefs.

            1.2.11.2.2.2.2. Pro:
            Many Jews have gone through martyrdom as a form of kiddush hashem [522], sometimes to avoid conversion to Christianity.

          1.2.11.2.2.3. Con:
          There are several competing explanations for religious martyrdom.

            1.2.11.2.2.3.1. Pro:
            Those who believe in God don't realize that their love for god blinds them, preventing them from logically assessing the decision to be a martyr.

            1.2.11.2.2.3.2. Pro:
            People sometimes voluntarily make sacrifices in the name of strongly held community beliefs. This is why young men go to war, government officials stuck to their posts during a Japanese Tsunami [523], and parents insist on female circumcision for their daughters.

              1.2.11.2.2.3.2.1. Con:
              In the case of the 11 faithful apostles, this is obviously not what happened. In their case, they were in a place to know what happened. They were eyewitnesses. Yet to a man, they never recanted their story, even in the faith of persecution and death. To believe 11 men maintained a lie for decades, even to their own disadvantage, is illogical and unreasonable.

            1.2.11.2.2.3.3. Pro:
            How unlikely it is that someone would be willing to be killed for a false belief depends on the perceived risk of being killed, the possible rewards and the tolerance of the individual to risk.

            1.2.11.2.2.3.4. Pro:
            Martyrdom can be achieved through steady desensitisation and role modelling by authority figures.

              1.2.11.2.2.3.4.1. Pro:
              A far simpler explanation for martyrdom would be that it was a culmination of self-sacrificial behavour (e.g. chastity, submission during marriage etc.) stemming from indoctrination beginning from birth and reinforced by all authority figures and peers.

          1.2.11.2.2.4. Pro:
          Millions of Christians [524] have been martyred over the centuries for their religious beliefs, indicating a genuine belief in the existence of God.

            1.2.11.2.2.4.1. Con:
            New Testament scholar Candida Moss argues that "Christians were never the victims of sustained, targeted persecution." [525]

              1.2.11.2.2.4.1.1. Con:
              During the 1500's Christians were systemically targeted, persecuted and murdered by majority religion powers. One of the most horrific periods was in 1572 [526].

                1.2.11.2.2.4.1.1.1. Con:
                Violence and persecution among different denominations of Christians, such as Catholics and Protestants, is not an example of persecution of Christians as such.

              1.2.11.2.2.4.1.2. Con:
              Moss claims that Christians weren't persecuted for their beliefs, but does state that they were executed for "publicly denying the divine status of the emperor" - which is a fundamental part of Christian belief (that there is only one God).

              1.2.11.2.2.4.1.3. Con:
              In the Annals 15.44, written by Roman historian Tacitus, Jesus and the Christians are mentioned. It recounts [527] how Emperor Nero went after Christians in order to draw attention away from himself after Rome's fire of 64 AD.

              1.2.11.2.2.4.1.4. Pro:
              According to Harari [528], the Roman persecutions of Christians over five centuries amounted to the deaths of no more than a few thousand people.

          1.2.11.2.2.5. Con:
          Oscar Wilde [529] famously quipped, "A thing is not necessarily true because someone dies for it." Accordingly, throughout history, many have chosen to die for causes that have proven to be unworthy [530].

            1.2.11.2.2.5.1. Con:
            A majority of martyrs did not have first-hand proof that their religion was true or if their cause was worthy. In contrast, the Christian apostles who were martyred knew through first-hand experience [531] that what they believed was true.

              1.2.11.2.2.5.1.1. Con:
              If Jesus were resurrected, it may be true that the apostles were in a position to know firsthand about it. But if Jesus wasn't actually resurrected, the apostles being in the same position wouldn't matter.

            1.2.11.2.2.5.2. Pro:
            Many people have died and continue to die on both sides of religious wars and for religious causes. They cannot all be right, so dying for a cause is not proof that one is right.

            1.2.11.2.2.5.3. Pro:
            Breatharians [532], like Jasmuheen [533], put their life in jeopardy for their indisputably false beliefs, namely, that human beings can live solely on air.

            1.2.11.2.2.5.4. Pro:
            The Aztecs used human sacrifices to keep the sun aloft.

              1.2.11.2.2.5.4.1. Con:
              Those sacrificed by the Aztecs were often captives taken in battle [534] and sacrificed against their will; these are not examples of martyrs.

              1.2.11.2.2.5.4.2. Pro:
              Aztec human sacrifices are comparable to martyrdom [535] in other major religions like Islam, as the afterlife is portrayed as a paradise that one can attain by, among other things, laying down one's life.

          1.2.11.2.2.6. Con:
          History is written by the victors. The stories of early martyrs might have been "improved" in order to paint the whole religion in a better light.

            1.2.11.2.2.6.1. Pro:
            Stories often embellish the truth and exaggerate, mainly if their main purpose is to spread a message or persuade someone.

              1.2.11.2.2.6.1.1. Pro:
              Luke 1 [536] does not claim to be an accurate account but one designed to persuade.

            1.2.11.2.2.6.2. Pro:
            People have a psychological inclination to root for the underdogs [537]. Stories of extreme martyrdom and great deeds inspire devotion and sympathy.

            1.2.11.2.2.6.3. Con:
            Christianity has plenty of examples of early Christian cowards (Peter), people slow to understand (the disciples) and other embarrassing testimony. It is not a movement that seems to recast it's characters as heroes.

              1.2.11.2.2.6.3.1. Pro:
              Peter was called "Satan" by Jesus. The disciples fled in terror while the women were found at the cross and were the first to the tomb in a society that did not value women or their testimony! The only "hero" in the story is Jesus himself.

              1.2.11.2.2.6.3.2. Con:
              The narrative of "bad" turning into "good" with Christianity as a catalyst of that change is one of the central parts of Christian lore and teaching. The existence of said examples does not contest the possibility of existence of embellished martyrdom stories.

        1.2.11.2.3. Con:
        The shared understanding of God is disassociated from the record of how religious leaders act in accordance to their shared core beliefs, on such a large scale that would suggest there was no God at all.

          1.2.11.2.3.1. Pro:
          The name of "God" has been used for malicious things such as a point of bigotry, racism, fascism, and a lot more.

          1.2.11.2.3.2. Pro:
          God, as the Abrahamic religions [538] understand him, formed a covenant with Abraham. This suggests they share the same God, yet these religions' historical relationships and questionable leadership tactics are proof enough that God does not exist.

            1.2.11.2.3.2.1. Con:
            -> See discussion #8539: Religion has been a good thing for humankind.

            1.2.11.2.3.2.2. Con:
            It is commonly assumed that the concept of God is consistent across Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. This is not the case in many of the most important aspects of any understanding of God, including salvation, his relationship with men, and many other key considerations.

              1.2.11.2.3.2.2.1. Pro:
              In Christianity, God is Trinitarian... one God consisting of three persons. Judaism and Islam are strictly Unitarian... one God, one person.

              1.2.11.2.3.2.2.2. Pro:
              In Islam, salvation is found in obedience to Allah. In Christianity, salvation is found by faith in Christ's obedience to God through his salvific death and resurrection.

              1.2.11.2.3.2.2.3. Pro:
              In Christianity, God is knowable on intimate terms... we can call him "Abba Father". This is less true in Judaism, and blasphemous in Islam, in which God is considered to be so "other" to man that he is practically incomprehensible.

              1.2.11.2.3.2.2.4. Con:
              The idea of God may differ religion to religion, just as their cultures and traditions do, but the account of God's covenant with Abraham is indicated in each religion's foundational narrative. From self-reported accounts of genealogy, these religions follow the same God.

                1.2.11.2.3.2.2.4.1. Con:
                A few shared stories are hardly sufficient to claim identity. If God is immutable, and these religions differ about key aspects of God, it's obvious that at least two (and perhaps all three) of them are wrong in their belief.

              1.2.11.2.3.2.2.5. Con:
              They share genealogy [539], Abraham is a founder of all three, that do in fact worship the same God.

            1.2.11.2.3.2.3. Pro:
            The holy wars and conflicts [540] between each other are in direct opposition to their core beliefs [541], and are especially troubling in light of the fact they follow the same God.

              1.2.11.2.3.2.3.1. Pro:
              The similarities between the core teachings of these religions [542] suggest looking after one another is one's duty, and that killing one another is morally wrong.

              1.2.11.2.3.2.3.2. Pro:
              The leaders of these religions [543], that share genealogy, instructed their followers that these merciless murders were a noble path to attain salvation. [544]

              1.2.11.2.3.2.3.3. Con:
              Claims to follow the same God do not mean that they do, in fact, follow the same God.

            1.2.11.2.3.2.4. Con:
            The interpretations that different people take and their actions upon those interpretations do not affect His existence.

            1.2.11.2.3.2.5. Con:
            This assumes that ignoring something (e.g. in this case God and his laws) is the same as it not existing, which in untrue

            1.2.11.2.3.2.6. Con:
            The same God who made a covenant with Abraham warned the family of Abraham against false prophets, teachers, etc, which suggests that many associated with Abraham would claim to know God but would know wrongly.

          1.2.11.2.3.3. Con:
          Those religious leaders are not acting in accordance with his teaching, so their words/actions do not reflect God's.

            1.2.11.2.3.3.1. Pro:
            It would be a tu quoque fallacy to suggest that the hypocrisy of theists counts as evidence against their claims.

            1.2.11.2.3.3.2. Con:
            Yet their followers believe otherwise, act on their leaders' teachings, and die believing they deserve eternal salvation.

              1.2.11.2.3.3.2.1. Con:
              With respect to the existence of God, this is a non sequitur. There is no logical connection between the sincerity of belief and the likelihood of it being true.

            1.2.11.2.3.3.3. Con:
            God as an all-knowing, all-powerful and completely good being intervened heavily during the time the scriptures narrate. If he existed, he would intervene at some point, or stop those individuals from becoming leaders of his followers in the first place. But he did not.

              1.2.11.2.3.3.3.1. Con:
              This claim is based on a very specific view of the hypothetical will of God. Humans are not in a position to claim that God would not permit free will in these cases.

              1.2.11.2.3.3.3.2. Con:
              When one tracks timelines carefully, there is no good case that God is said to have "intervened heavily heavily during the time the scriptures narrate".

          1.2.11.2.3.4. Con:
          Religious leaders and this so called "Subversion" are their choices as individual leaders which are fundamentally people still. God is Immutable and also God is able to change any aspect of Creation.Creation is an aspect of God's will or in other words:creation is one of God's artworks painted with the crayons of life and death.

            1.2.11.2.3.4.1. Con:
            If it were God's will that those actions not be done, an all-knowing, all-powerful, and benevolent being would do something to stop those individuals from gaining those positions of power. Yet, through the course of history [545] has not done so.

          1.2.11.2.3.5. Pro:
          God is not immutable. Religious leaders subvert his will in the aim of greater political power and material wealth.

            1.2.11.2.3.5.1. Con:
            God's will includes granting permission to humans to misbehave. This is neither a subversion of his will, nor a contradiction of immutability.

            1.2.11.2.3.5.2. Pro:
            Christian leaders sold indulgences to the wealthy in return for mitigated punishments for wrongdoings.

              -> See 1.2.11.2.3.3.

            1.2.11.2.3.5.3. Pro:
            Rabbis, Priests, and Imams have historically been caught or found guilty of abusing their positions of power for sex with children. Pedophilia sex being understood as an act of dominance, would suggest these religious leaders acted to perversely declare their power.

              1.2.11.2.3.5.3.1. Con:
              -> See 1.2.11.2.3.3.

          1.2.11.2.3.6. Con:
          The "disassociation" from the "record of how religious leaders act in accordance to their shared core beliefs" [sic] could equally "suggest" that God as described in the Bible does in fact exist and that he did in fact create beings with the capacity for meaningful choice, even the choice to act in discordance with his own personality and design.

            1.2.11.2.3.6.1. Con:
            Then God is either not all powerful, or all good.

          1.2.11.2.3.7. Con:
          Making blanket generalizations about all "religious leaders" on the basis of the behavior of some "religious leaders" is invalid.

            1.2.11.2.3.7.1. Pro:
            Such generalizations can be made of any reasonably large group of people.

            1.2.11.2.3.7.2. Con:
            No one is referring to all religions, this claim focuses on the Abrahamic religions.

              1.2.11.2.3.7.2.1. Con:
              This is still a blanket generalization. There is no evidence that the behavior of leaders in the Abrahamic faiths falls below a non-arbitrary standard, below which would count against the existence of God.

          1.2.11.2.3.8. Pro:
          Religious leaders don't necessarily have anything to do with God. There are those who try to act in God's name and those who do not. We are called to a relationship with His Son Jesus Christ which must NEVER go through other men.

          1.2.11.2.3.9. Con:
          The two ideas in this statement are not linked. Solely because there is wide debate on a topic does not mean that the entire topic is invalid. Many aspects of politics are hotly debated, but this does not mean that the freedom for anyone to murder without punishment is any less wrong.

        1.2.11.2.4. Con:
        The symptoms of some mental disorders like schizophrenia [546] cause people to hear voices in their head. Without a modern understanding of this condition, an Iron Age man may have perceived it as divine revelation, or at the very least, supernatural.

          1.2.11.2.4.1. Con:
          Altered states of consciousness including dreams, hallucinations, astral projections and other out-of-body experiences, often are of a spiritual nature or are instructive, hinting at a greater intelligence or at least the existence of something beyond the physical.

            1.2.11.2.4.1.1. Con:
            -> See 1.1.7.3.1.

            1.2.11.2.4.1.2. Con:
            Dreams, hallucinations, astral projections and OBEs find physical expressions and can be interpreted as body phenomenons. Psychological experiences can explain and reproduce such phenomenons without involving "God".

            1.2.11.2.4.1.3. Con:
            Dreams and hallucinations can be interpreted in any way to confirm your beliefs. If you believe in 'anything', you can then twist dreams to fit within the narrative of your beliefs. Who's to say dreams don't 'actually' show that we are living in a virtual universe created by omnipotent chickens?

            1.2.11.2.4.1.4. Con:
            All mental states can be proven to be a function of the material operation of the brain.  There is no science suggesting there is anything supernatural going on. When a brain dies, it ceases any mental activity.

          -> See 1.1.7.3.1.

          1.2.11.2.4.3. Pro:
          Hallucinations are extremely common [547] even within the normal population. Yet, these experiences are not evidence of the existence of anything observed or experienced in the hallucination.

            1.2.11.2.4.3.1. Pro:
            Studies [548] have shown the religious hallucinations are common symptoms of a variety of mental health disorders.

            1.2.11.2.4.3.2. Pro:
            There is no objective standard for whether a given religious experience is a hallucination or a revelation. It is judged differently by observers [549], in accordance with their bias, such as their upbringing.

            1.2.11.2.4.3.3. Con:
            Unlike religious experiences, hallucinations are not shared. They take place in one mind independent and irrespective of another.

              1.2.11.2.4.3.3.1. Pro:
              Eye witness accounts by a large number of people cannot rationally be explained as a shared hallucination.

                1.2.11.2.4.3.3.1.1. Con:
                The earliest account of mass hallucination in western society was pre 1500AD, where a nun started biting people and it became 'infectious'. More recent accounts including the Ketereh, Malaysia episode where a group of students claimed to see a face of pure evil [550].

                1.2.11.2.4.3.3.1.2. Con:
                Theories suggest that there are scientific explanations for the historically common belief in witches

                  1.2.11.2.4.3.3.1.2.1. Pro:
                  It has been theorised that hallucinogenic properties in contaminated rye [551] caused consumers to believe in witches, and is largely responsible for witch trials and executions.

                  1.2.11.2.4.3.3.1.2.2. Pro:
                  It has been suggested that the witch related hysteria in Salem in 1692 was related to the symptoms of PTSD which has been theorised as afflicting many civilians following the Native American Wars [552].

              1.2.11.2.4.3.3.2. Con:
              There have been shared hallucinations recorded as well. The phenomenon is called "folie à deux [553]."

            1.2.11.2.4.3.4. Con:
            This claim equates, without defense of such equivocation, an individual's religious experiences and hallucination. Without evidence to show that these are the same, this claim becomes a strawman argument.

            1.2.11.2.4.3.5. Con:
            There is no way to prove that everything beyond human understanding is a hallucination. Using this as an argument against the existence of God is both a false premise and circular argument.

            1.2.11.2.4.3.6. Con:
            There is no empirical way to establish that this life and the world we perceive is not just one long and convincing hallucination. The quality of the experience proves itself.

              1.2.11.2.4.3.6.1. Con:
              Being less certain that there exists an objective external reality at all doesn't in any way make us more certain that that external reality includes a God.

              1.2.11.2.4.3.6.2. Con:
              A hallucination is defined as "an experience involving the apparent perception of something not present". It is not possible to have a hallucination within a hallucination, as the person within the hallucination would not be present to experience their own hallucinations.

          1.2.11.2.4.4. Con:
          In ancient civilizations, people had some understanding of mental illness, as evidened by mentions of "madness," and believed in demon possession. Yet, these groups selectively accepted certain individuals' claims of divine revelation, choosing not to believe that it was madness or possession.

            1.2.11.2.4.4.1. Con:
            It is common for relatives and friends to deny the reality of a loved ones mental illness, it can be more comforting to believe that they are in contact with divine beings than have an illness which could impact the family's social standing, marriage prospects etc.

            1.2.11.2.4.4.2. Con:
            Those in a position of power such as a priest may make a conscious decision to take advantage of a confused mentally ill person and use the symptoms of their mental illness to further the respect and faith he has in a community.

            1.2.11.2.4.4.3. Con:
            A person who has only known their religion and has no other worldly knowledge to offer an alternate view may decide that the most logical conclusion is that either they or someone they love is in communication with a divine being.

            1.2.11.2.4.4.4. Con:
            In Mesopotamia diseases and mental disorders [554] were believed to be caused by specific deities. This aspect shows that Mesopotamians believed all disease, mental illness and any kind of revelation was all because of Gods.

      1.2.11.3. Con:
      Religion confers several positive psychosocial benefits on humanity. Thus, it makes pragmatic sense to believe in God.

        1.2.11.3.1. Pro:
        Choosing a religious lifestyle has a net positive effect on people; therefore, one should believe in God regardless of how correct the view.

          1.2.11.3.1.1. Pro:
          A Pew 2012 study [555] found that actively religious participants were 5 % more likely to say that they are 'Very happy' than unaffiliated participants.

            1.2.11.3.1.1.1. Con:
            This 5% increase in happiness could be the result of the close-knit community that goes along with religion. People could experience a similar boost in happiness through joining a club, volunteering, or being more engaged in their communities without having to join a religion.

          1.2.11.3.1.2. Con:
          Even if one 'should' believe of a god's existence, this is not reason to be convinced that a god exists.

          1.2.11.3.1.3. Pro:
          The unity and generosity of religious communities supports the idea that God brings people together.

            1.2.11.3.1.3.1. Con:
            The unity and generosity of religious communities only supports the idea that the concept of a God brings people together, it is not an indication that God exists.

              1.2.11.3.1.3.1.1. Pro:
              Social gatherings around fictional universes (sci-fi conventions for example) can bring people together in unity and generosity.

            1.2.11.3.1.3.2. Con:
            Any shared value system (e.g., veganism), cause (e.g., activism), or event (natural calamity) can bring people together. This effect is not unique to the existence of God.

            1.2.11.3.1.3.3. Con:
            Bringing people together is not always a positive outcome. Religious fundamentalists, for example, can bring people together to perpetuate extremism [556] (p. 23).

          1.2.11.3.1.4. Con:
          An increase in happiness when joining a religion is contingent on a lot of factors, including if the religion accepts you. Several studies have shown that same-sex attracted people [557] have reduced happiness when joining a church that does not accept them.

          1.2.11.3.1.5. Pro:
          Adopting a similar philosophy of people with whom you can benefit by association is a time-honored practice.

          1.2.11.3.1.6. Pro:
          There is peer-reviewed research which supports the effects of prayer [558].

            1.2.11.3.1.6.1. Con:
            The cited article [559] is limited to visual and auditory improvements. It is an overgeneralization to assume that beneficial effects from a very limited scope of research could provide sufficient evidence for the existence of god.

            1.2.11.3.1.6.2. Con:
            Proof of the effects of prayer does not correlate to proof of god(s).

            1.2.11.3.1.6.3. Con:
            The placebo effect is well documented with sugar pills as well.

        1.2.11.3.2. Pro:
        The role of divine being such as God is typically intrinsically linked to stories of the afterlife in a vast amount of cultures and religions. It is a convienient and encouraged explanation to compensate for the loss felt by others following a death. Such beliefs alleviate grief and promote a feeling of hope of reunion with and peace for the deceased.

        1.2.11.3.3. Pro:
        God exists for those who need him, similar to the idea that "beauty is in the eye of the beholder."

        1.2.11.3.4. Con:
        There are pragmatic reasons not to believe in God as well.

          1.2.11.3.4.1. Pro:
          The idea of worshiping a God for metaphysical reasons and the power Christianity gives other men over other people in this world poses a conflict of interests.

          1.2.11.3.4.2. Pro:
          Such reasons include not having to follow set-in-stone rituals that use up one's time and energy (e.g. prayer five times a day for islam, shabbath for judaism, church on sunday for christianism, and many others )

            1.2.11.3.4.2.1. Con:
            Many people enjoy [560] rituals such as prayer.

          1.2.11.3.4.3. Pro:
          People don't have to feel guilty for normal behaviours such as (but not restricted to) masturbation or out-of-wedlock-sex; indeed religions tend to shame such practices whereas they are actually normal and healthy [561]. The guilt that such activities bring can prevents people from doing them, or cause mental distress when people do.

          1.2.11.3.4.4. Pro:
          Different meats are forbidden [562] in different religions. An atheist can eat whatever foods one wants, whenever one wants (Ramadan in Islam, Lent in Christianity).

        1.2.11.3.5. Con:
        Pragmatism is irrelevant to philosophy and truth.

          1.2.11.3.5.1. Con:
          The meaning of hypotheses can be found by tracing their ‘practical consequences’ – their implications for experience in specific situations. Thus, the hypothesis that God exists can be judged based on its practical consequences.

            1.2.11.3.5.1.1. Pro:
            Belief in the existence of God contributes to social progress. Thus, 'God exists' is true because the concept operates successfully within a conceptual scheme that advances the well-being of humanity.

              1.2.11.3.5.1.1.1. Con:
              The same could be said of non-belief in the existence of God based on the advancement of human well-being in secular countries like Japan and Sweden. Thus 'God does not exist' is true because the concept operates successfully as well.

              1.2.11.3.5.1.1.2. Con:
              Social progress based on faith tends to only advance well being if everyone believes in the same faith. Events such as the St Bartholomew's Day massacre [563], cannot be accurately described as advancing the well-being of humanity.

          1.2.11.3.5.2. Pro:
          Shared religious beliefs confer several psychological benefits, regardless of the actual existence of God. Thus, the benefits of belief in God do not support the existence of God.

            1.2.11.3.5.2.1. Pro:
            God does not physically exist but serves as a moral metaphor for us to distinguish between right and wrong.

            1.2.11.3.5.2.2. Pro:
            There is good evolutionary benefit from assumption of a false positive. Belief in God can be attributed to the evolutionary mechanism, Agenticity, [564] that leads to people assuming there is a god who may punish them if they don't behave. This explains why a belief in a god would evolve as a defence mechanism regardless of whether or not there is actually a god.

            1.2.11.3.5.2.3. Pro:
            Many religious groups fiercely dispute that belief has no benefit. There's a popular notion of "Placebo God" in which God is seen as a beneficial idea even if untrue.

            1.2.11.3.5.2.4. Pro:
            Earliest god figures were that of the sun, moon, stars, and animals known as animism [565]. As a way to bring order to society and people wanting to gain power over others, feigning communion with the gods or spirits would achieve this. This would provide an evolutionary societal benefit. Insisting laws be divinely mandated could keep people from killing each other and provide for a better primitive society, creating early stability, and benefiting those who believed.

            1.2.11.3.5.2.5. Pro:
            A commonly cited one is that shared beliefs allow communities of >150 people to trust strangers thus promoting greater exchange of goods and ideas and thereby promoting survival odds of those sharing [566] the belief [567].

          1.2.11.3.5.3. Pro:
          Just because a belief has psychosocial benefits does not make the belief legitimate. For example, it may be beneficial for the psychosocial wellbeing of his congregation if a priest is believed to be celibate, but the reality may be he is in fact abusing young parishioners.

          1.2.11.3.5.4. Pro:
          There are many inconvenient truths.

          1.2.11.3.5.5. Pro:
          Illusions can have pragmatic benefits [568], but this does not mean they reflect reality.

      1.2.11.4. Pro:
      God is just an excuse to avoid our fear of death as a whole.

      1.2.11.5. Pro:
      -> See 1.1.7.3.

      1.2.11.6. Pro:
      -> See 1.1.7.6.

      1.2.11.7. Pro:
      God existence drifts from an instinct collocated near the epilepsy-related part in our brains [569] and not from logical thinking.

      1.2.11.8. Con:
      Belief in God is intrinsic to human psychology [570] and fundamentally instinctual.

        1.2.11.8.1. Pro:
        Human desires, like hunger and thirst, come from the biological drive to seek something real in the world (e.g. water and food). As human beings have a desire to believe in God, it is likely that this desire exists because God is a real entity.

          1.2.11.8.1.1. Con:
          These desires can be explained in neurological terms without the existence of an unseen realm.

            1.2.11.8.1.1.1. Con:
            Human beings experience hunger because we need food. This is a neurological function, yet we do not disregard the reality that food must exist. Reducing something to a neurological function does not invalidate the reality of the need or desire nor the object that will satisfy it.

              1.2.11.8.1.1.1.1. Pro:
              The fact that we hunger for something does not suggest we will be satisfied, just that the object exists; a person stuck on an island will be hungry, but may starve to death. Likewise, some people may never see God, even though they yearn for what is beyond our world.

                1.2.11.8.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
                Comparing universal psychological states such as hunger to non-universal states such as desiring God is a false analogy [571].

          1.2.11.8.1.2. Pro:
          The inherent requirement and craving for God in virtually every culture suggests an evolutionary benefit for acceptance of the existence of God. Thus, the a priori existence of God can be inferred.

            1.2.11.8.1.2.1. Con:
            Evolutionary benefits do not have to correlate to facts. It is evolutionarily beneficial for humans to be omnivorous. This does not mean that humans are obligate omnivores.

            1.2.11.8.1.2.2. Con:
            The selection pressure to conform to religious belief and practice was man-made through punishment, isolation, and other disadvantages. This had nothing to do with God's existence.

              1.2.11.8.1.2.2.1. Pro:
              With each generation indoctrinating the next well before critical thinking develops, it becomes ingrained, and is as much cultural as religious. It is a "requirement," especially in religiously homogeneous regions. The existence of a tradition alone, does not prove its worth, or that it is logical.

            1.2.11.8.1.2.3. Con:
            If anything, this evolutionary benefit would imply that only those who have a tendency to be gullible or compliant are more likely to survive; this can, in no way, be considered to be acceptable evidence for the existence of God.

              1.2.11.8.1.2.3.1. Pro:
              Humans evolved to be superstitious, because this conferred a survival benefit. This does not mean superstitions—be they related or unrelated to God—are real.

            1.2.11.8.1.2.4. Con:
            The "requirement and craving for God" is more likely a craving for understanding of the unknown, which is then filled with a created "God" because it is convenient to give the answer: "God made it that way," and be satisfied.

              1.2.11.8.1.2.4.1. Pro:
              These can be defined as a mere "hole" in the scientific theory that needs to be scientifically filled.

                1.2.11.8.1.2.4.1.1. Pro:
                This can be easily seen in the evolution of politheistic religion, in which every deity had a "power" (Zeus -> lightning, Apollo -> Sun) that were easily eradicated with the comprehension of the real world through science.

                1.2.11.8.1.2.4.1.2. Con:
                The idea that science has proven that there are not personalities controlling the forces of nature is philosophically erroneous because demonstrating the mechanism of an action or force does not show why it happens.

                  1.2.11.8.1.2.4.1.2.1. Pro:
                  For example, it's always possible the sky is blue because it's an artistic choice and that the scientific explanation of how it is made blue is the mechanism used by the artist to achieve the desired effect.

                    1.2.11.8.1.2.4.1.2.1.1. Con:
                    The sky is not actually blue [572].

          1.2.11.8.1.3. Con:
          This claim is logically faulty.

            1.2.11.8.1.3.1. Pro:
            The analogy between hunger or thirst and spiritual desires is weak, which invalidates the argument.

              1.2.11.8.1.3.1.1. Pro:
              The cravings for something beyond the physical are not universal in the way hunger and thirst are universal.

                1.2.11.8.1.3.1.1.1. Pro:
                Desire for food is seen throughout the animal kingdom while the desire to believe in God is seen only in humans.

              1.2.11.8.1.3.1.2. Pro:
              Food is needed for subsistence. In contrast, belief in God only serves as a convenient explanation for how the world works and for what happens after death.

              1.2.11.8.1.3.1.3. Pro:
              The absence of a belief in God has no verifiable ill effects on those lacking them, in the same way starvation and thirst do.

                1.2.11.8.1.3.1.3.1. Pro:
                Atheists and agnostics feel no particular spiritual drive; nonetheless, they lead perfectly fulfilling, happy lives.

            1.2.11.8.1.3.2. Pro:
            This claim commits the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy [573]. Deducing that God must exist because some people search for Him is like deducing that thirst creates water without ever having seen any water.

            1.2.11.8.1.3.3. Pro:
            This argument is a perfect example of confirmation bias [574].

          1.2.11.8.1.4. Pro:
          C.S. Lewis has pointed out, in "Mere Christianity [575]," that we thirst, and there is water; we hunger, and there is food. For every "craving" we have, there exists an object of that craving.

            1.2.11.8.1.4.1. Con:
            C.S. Lewis was demonstrably wrong. Sexual fetishes, such as furaphilia [576], a craving for anthropomorphic animal sexual partners exist. This does not mean furries, anthropomorphic animals, exist.

            1.2.11.8.1.4.2. Con:
            C.S. Lewis may have been a theologist, and a well loved author, but he was not a scientist. His comments on the nature of desire can only be taken as his personal opinion and not conclusions of peer reviewed research. Anyone could make the same assertion as him and it is only his well known name that lends it any semblance of credibility. This is clearly an example of the appeal to authority fallacy.

          1.2.11.8.1.5. Con:
          Evolved characteristics can be superfluous or counterproductive.

            1.2.11.8.1.5.1. Pro:
            Human beings have evolved to seek and determine patterns, to the point that humans falsely determine patterns. This innate trait is as natural to humans as any other biological drive, but does not derive fact.

              1.2.11.8.1.5.1.1. Pro:
              If one sees a connection between two unrelated data points, it does not mean there is in fact a connection. This is called apophenia [577].

            1.2.11.8.1.5.2. Pro:
            Human beings may desire the existence of magic, dragons, or extraterrestrial life, but this is not proof that any of those things actually exist.

            1.2.11.8.1.5.3. Pro:
            Biological drives evolve because the drive itself provides a survival benefit. That benefit need not be tied to the physical existence of something. Otherwise, all superstitions would be real.

              1.2.11.8.1.5.3.1. Pro:
              Paul Kurtz argued that because nature is full of chaos and impermanence, it can cause great unease. Some seek to counter that with something stable and eternal. This is what "God" gives them; he's a safe harbor in a storm.

            1.2.11.8.1.5.4. Pro:
            Dogs lick their wounds even though it is counterproductive [578] for them to do so.

            1.2.11.8.1.5.5. Pro:
            Cancer is a case of misuse of evolutionary traits (such as cell growth, replication, irrigation).

        1.2.11.8.2. Pro:
        For some people, psychological methods reliably bring out a sense of presence of God and similar figures, depending on the beliefs of the subject.

          1.2.11.8.2.1. Con:
          The ability to reliably stimulate a sense of the presence of God only proves that people's "sense of the presence of God" is suspect and not indicative of the actual existence of anything outside of the brain.

          1.2.11.8.2.2. Con:
          This reasoning is not applicable to similar claims. For example, the claim, "For some people, psychological methods reliably bring out a feeling of floating. Therefore, they must actually be floating," is false.

          1.2.11.8.2.3. Pro:
          An example is the effects of the God helmet [579] and similar experimental devices and protocols.

        1.2.11.8.3. Con:
        Humans are social animals, and naturally predisposed to understand the world in those terms, which produces superstition; this is a plausible explanation for why children would be inclined to teleological beliefs.

        1.2.11.8.4. Con:
        The postulated atheist argument (implied by the linked source) that children cannot distinguish between imagination and reality is a strawman.

        1.2.11.8.5. Pro:
        Belief in deific beings spans cultures and various cultural developmental milestones.

          1.2.11.8.5.1. Con:
          Things that are intrinsic to human nature or psychology do not necessarily correlate to being true.

        1.2.11.8.6. Con:
        -> See 1.2.11.8.5.1.

        1.2.11.8.7. Con:
        Intrinsic is defined as "belonging naturally, essential". If this were true then humans lacking belief in God would be in constant conflict with their instincts. Atheists for example, can live fulfilling lives without ever feeling they are missing religion.

        1.2.11.8.8. Con:
        The admission of religion as an intrinsic social behavior, damages the claim of a god actually existing, more then it bolsters it.

          1.2.11.8.8.1. Pro:
          -> See 1.2.11.8.3.

          1.2.11.8.8.2. Pro:
          -> See 1.1.7.2.

          1.2.11.8.8.3. Pro:
          It makes no sense for a god to create beings to be intrinsically disposed towards religion, but not intrinsically disposed towards a particular religion.

          1.2.11.8.8.4. Pro:
          Intrinsic social behavior [580] can be observed in animals, lending greater credence to naturalistic explanations over divine ones.

      1.2.11.9. Pro:
      Increasingly, human beings are looking for meaning and purpose from within than from an external divine being. This shows that God is becoming more and more irrelevant to determine human meaning and purpose.

        1.2.11.9.1. Pro:
        Global belief patterns [581] suggest that people are becoming less religious [582] but more spiritual [583]. This implies that benefits previously associated with organized religion (e.g., meaning and purpose) can now be derived through individual spirituality.

        1.2.11.9.2. Con:
        Where human beings derive their meaning and purpose from has no relevance to the question of God's existence; whether they fail to consider God has no impact on his existence.

      1.2.11.10. Pro:
      There are human experiences ('divine moments', 'spiritual moments', moments of ultimate joy, serenity or peace) that can easily be attributed to a god but can also be explained in other, more rational ways. It is not necessary to attribute these experiences, which might just be biological processes and "epiphanies" in our brains, to a superior being.

      1.2.11.11. Pro:
      In most instances, followers are born into their religion. Their parents expose them to faithful practices and religious experiences from a young age. This is a form of indoctrination, which cultivates poor tolerance for divergent thought.

        1.2.11.11.1. Con:
        This is a genetic fallacy [584]. Hence, how someone was brought up has no bearing on the veracity of their beliefs. Each belief must be evaluated in terms of the evidence for it.

          1.2.11.11.1.1. Con:
          Beliefs only have to be evaluated in terms of the evidence for them to be justified true beliefs. People can believe unjustified things as well.

            1.2.11.11.1.1.1. Pro:
            One can believe that their partner is faithful and the evidence may even support this. However, that belief can still be incorrect.

        1.2.11.11.2. Pro:
        Stating that the means of obtaining information is tainted, therefore the information gained from it is too, is nothing more that an example of Fruit of the poisonous tree. [585] This is an argument that is good enough for the U.S. judicial system.

          1.2.11.11.2.1. Con:
          The U.S. judicial system is not considered to be very good in global comparisons [586]. Using a poor quality benchmark does not convey good evidence.

        1.2.11.11.3. Con:
        The same explanation also applies to non-religious families. In other words, atheists may have been raised in atheism by their parents.

          1.2.11.11.3.1. Pro:
          Darwin's grandfather Erasmus Darwin [587] likely influenced his beliefs and theories.

          1.2.11.11.3.2. Con:
          The scientific method is an antidote to indoctrination: any inherited knowledge would be verifiable, and one does not assume that a theory is correct without adequate proof. This supports atheistic upbringing but opposes theistic upbringing.

      1.2.11.12. Pro:
      God is an association of agency where there is none (Type I error [588]).

        1.2.11.12.1. Pro:
        From an evolutionary perspective, Type 1 errors have more survival value than Type 2 errors because assigning agency to the unknown may have saved humans from potential danger. As a result, many people now see God where there might be none.

          1.2.11.12.1.1. Pro:
          Religion formed naturally from hyperactive agency detection [589] - a tendency to attribute natural or unexplained events to a sentient agent (in this case, God).

            1.2.11.12.1.1.1. Con:
            Studies have shown that, while believers in superstition and the paranormal do show hyperactive agency detection [590], believers in classical religion don't. In fact, some studies have found that atheists and skeptics often have underactive agency detection [591], meaning they deny the existence of agency even when it is actually there.

            1.2.11.12.1.1.2. Pro:
            Psychological studies indicate people have tendency to shift responsibility to somebody else when many people are present. The God could be a target for such shift when no other target is available. Groupthink in wikipedia [592], Diffusion of responsibility [593]

            1.2.11.12.1.1.3. Con:
            Modern theological arguments (teleological, moral, ontological, cosmological) arrive at the existence of a God deductively, by revealing a situation that could only be properly explained by something we'd call a God, not by seeing unanswered questions and proposing a God to explain them.

        1.2.11.12.2. Con:
        By this logic, it can be argued that atheism is a cognitive error because it fails to ascribe agency when there is an agent at play.

          1.2.11.12.2.1. Con:
          Knowledge when soundly based upon current available evidence can be found to be wrong in the future, but it is not a cognitive error. Assumptions are cognitive errors.

          1.2.11.12.2.2. Con:
          The rational person begins with the null hypothesis: a thing is not true or does not exist, until it is proven to be true or to exist. Theism requires belief without sufficient evidence.

        1.2.11.12.3. Con:
        This claim is based on circular reasoning: this argument would be true only if God does not indeed exist.

  1.3. Pro:
  Philosophical arguments support the existence of God.

    1.3.1. Con:
    -> See 1.1.6.1.

    1.3.2. Con:
    It is not possible to strictly prove the existence of God on a rational level, but only on a spiritual level of being. Spiritual being is in many ways contrary to the rational approach. The more we try to rationally prove God, the more we move away from spirituality and from God itself.

      1.3.2.1. Con:
      If belief in the existence of god can't be proven to be rational, that by definition states said belief is irrational.

    1.3.3. Con:
    Philosophical arguments are not homogeneous. Therefore, there are strands of philosophy that disagree with the existence of God.

      1.3.3.1. Pro:
      Philosophical arguments which support the existence of one God would also support the existence of many Gods, hence undermining the classical depiction of the monotheistic God.

        1.3.3.1.1. Con:
        This is not true of Aristotle's "prime mover [594]" argument, also known as the argument from contingency.

        1.3.3.1.2. Con:
        The claim "At least one God exists" is separate from the claim "If at least one God exists, only one God exists" and is supported using separate evidence. An argument for the former claim is not rendered unsound just because it does not prove the latter claim.

        1.3.3.1.3. Pro:
        Philosophical arguments support the existence of the Roman [595] and Norse [596] Pantheons, which are widely believed [597] to not exist.

          1.3.3.1.3.1. Con:
          While the existence of Roman and Norse Pantheons is not consistent with some theologies, there are others which it is consistent with.

            1.3.3.1.3.1.1. Pro:
            For example, the Srimad Bhagavatam talks of one supreme God who us functioning under Him an assortment of demi-gods who over see the running of the material world, sort of like engineers.

          1.3.3.1.3.2. Con:
          There are people who believe in demi-gods and that they co-exist with a supereme God. An inclusivist or syncretistic approach would allow these demi-gods to be known by different names and stories in different cultures.

            1.3.3.1.3.2.1. Pro:
            For example, the bhakti tradition of India holds that God exists and is known by many names in different cultures and that He empowers demigods to over see the material affairs of the material world while He remains aloof in His spiritual abode. These various pantheons such as the Norse and Greek gods might be these same servants of God understood by different names and stories.

          1.3.3.1.3.3. Con:
          The classical arguments (the cosmological, contingency, ontological, and moral arguments) for God's existence would only allow for the existence of a single deity that is common to the general monotheisms.

            1.3.3.1.3.3.1. Con:
            Classical arguments don't hold more weight than others.

      1.3.3.2. Con:
      Apologetics is a branch of Christian philosophy [598] that provides systematic argumentation supporting the existence of God.

        1.3.3.2.1. Con:
        Apologetics attempts to rescue a God whose existence one has accepted a priori [599].

          1.3.3.2.1.1. Con:
          A priori beliefs can be justified [600] even without evidence.

            1.3.3.2.1.1.1. Con:
            Empiricists argue that no a priori [601] judgments are justified and that all justified beliefs are formed through experience.

          1.3.3.2.1.2. Con:
          The preaching done by skeptics can likewise be described as the endless attempt to justify beliefs which they accept a priori.

            1.3.3.2.1.2.1. Pro:
            The encounter Rupert Sheldrake had with Richard Dawkins illustrates this clearly youtu.be [602]

          1.3.3.2.1.3. Con:
          A truth accepted through a different kind of epistomology called self-evidence can be bolstered by other epistemologies.

            1.3.3.2.1.3.1. Pro:
            For exampe, we all accept the existence of the material world on a self-evident basis. The benefits that come from carrying this belief are consistent with it being true and therefore reinforce the belief.

          1.3.3.2.1.4. Con:
          The suggestion that apologetics can be dismissed on the grounds that its proponents accept the conclusion a priori is a clear example of the genetic fallacy [603].

          1.3.3.2.1.5. Con:
          The aim of apologetics is not to defend God, but to defend the apologist's belief in God --not to convince nonbelievers, but to demonstrate why the believer is convinced.

            1.3.3.2.1.5.1. Pro:
            The Christian definition of apologetics comes from 1 Peter 3:15, advising believers to be ready to give "a reason (apologia) for the hope that is in you". It is couched in a greater admonishment toward an outward manner that reflects the integrity of the individual's belief, as described in 1 Peter 3:14-16, with apologetics being only one facet of this manifestation.

            1.3.3.2.1.5.2. Pro:
            People should accept God based on testimonies and changed lives of His followers, which they can themselves experience if they allow themselves to have faith in God.

              1.3.3.2.1.5.2.1. Con:
              Personal experiences can be claimed for every religion and other extraordinary ideas. They are therefore unconvincing.

                1.3.3.2.1.5.2.1.1. Con:
                A loving God would reciprocate with sincere attempts to come closer to him regardless of theological details. The above argument is predicated on an exclusivist view of different religions or the idea that they are mutually exclusive. The exclusivist view which considers one religion true and all others false is its self logically incoherent with respect to the claim that God is all loving and compassionate. An all loving God would not be cold to sincere aspirants over theological details.

              1.3.3.2.1.5.2.2. Con:
              Changed lives can show that lives can be changed by ideas - but that does not show that those ideas are indeed true.

      1.3.3.3. Pro:
      Materialism arguments [604] do not support the existence of God.

        1.3.3.3.1. Con:
        As materialism is defined largely in terms of what it excludes, this is asking for evidence of absence.

          1.3.3.3.1.1. Con:
          It is appropriate to request evidence of absence from those who claim that a thing does not exist.

          1.3.3.3.1.2. Con:
          Materialism must also account for what it chooses to include (for instance: a belief in mind, combined with a rejection of objective moral principles, needs to be established as a non-arbitrary position).

            1.3.3.3.1.2.1. Con:
            There are people who believe that objective moral principles consistent with materialism exist, such as Sam Harris, so materialism should not be said to include a rejection of objective moral principles.

              1.3.3.3.1.2.1.1. Con:
              That some people believe a thing does not make it true. One must establish that Sam Harris (or whomever) is being fully consistent with materialism.

                1.3.3.3.1.2.1.1.1. Pro:
                Regarding this example, Harris writes [605]: "Some intuitions are truly basic to our thinking. I claim that the conviction that the worst possible misery for everyone is bad and should be avoided is among them." This is a siding with an axiomatic adherence to moral truth over materialism. It is, therefore, questionable whether Harris is actually a materialist.

              1.3.3.3.1.2.1.2. Con:
              Regardless of the particular example, the choice of accepting some claims about reality, while rejecting others, must be justified. If materialism is going to maintain that its reasons are non-arbitrary, it needs to provide a consistent standard by which it makes these judgments.

            1.3.3.3.1.2.2. Pro:
            Materialism makes a number of ontological and epistemological claims, and is as obligated to support those claims as any view.

            1.3.3.3.1.2.3. Pro:
            Materialism tends to justify itself by some variation of positivism [606]. This puts it at odds with axiology [607], but there is no reason to favor positivism (or materialism) over axiology.

            1.3.3.3.1.2.4. Pro:
            Materialists have notoriously been unable to solve the mind-body [608] problem, leading some materialists to deny the existence of our common experience of mental states (via eliminative materialism [609]).

        1.3.3.3.2. Con:
        Theistic claims on moral truth and the human mind are better supported than materialism

          1.3.3.3.2.1. Pro:
          As objective moral truth can't be cached out in materialist terms, materialism is implicitly committed to moral relativism and/or nihilism.

            1.3.3.3.2.1.1. Pro:
            The materialists are essentially running afoul of the is-ought problem [610].

          1.3.3.3.2.2. Pro:
          There is as much reason to accept one's moral sense as pointing to objective reality as there is to accept one's physical senses as pointing to (a different layer of) objective reality. Materialism, however, denies this.

            1.3.3.3.2.2.1. Con:
            One's "moral sense" is a term for an emotional reaction to things perceived with real senses - eyes, ears, etc. - and materialism does not and need not deny the objective reality of the actual things perceived with those senses.

              1.3.3.3.2.2.1.1. Con:
              To claim that the moral sense is purely emotional reaction is to presume that objective moral principles do not exist. It is begging the question to presume this before materialism is established.

              1.3.3.3.2.2.1.2. Con:
              Without an additional argument, it would be special pleading to assume that the moral sense is simply the product of emotion, while the physical senses are not simply the product of delusion.

            1.3.3.3.2.2.2. Con:
            This assumes that people's moral feelings are experienced as a sense that things are "objectively" wrong, which has no reason to be any more universal than belief in objective morality itself.

              1.3.3.3.2.2.2.1. Con:
              The typical human claim that something "is wrong" is a claim about objective fact. This is not only the understood meaning of "is", but is the only way to make sense of most conversation about moral claims: the demands that people make clearly reveal claims that are seen as binding on others—rather than a mere opinion, which others are free to take or leave without giving a reason.

              1.3.3.3.2.2.2.2. Pro:
              This would be assuming that people who don't believe in objective morality are denying the experience of their senses, or are otherwise in constant contradiction, with the only evidence being the subjective experience of those who do believe in objective morality.

            1.3.3.3.2.2.3. Pro:
            For any argument against the validity of the claims of the moral sense, a parallel argument can be made against the physical senses.

              1.3.3.3.2.2.3.1. Con:
              Moral claims describe qualitative experiences, more analogous to the "redness" of read than the observable frequency of photons. As such, the corresponding arguments against physical senses would only deny that "redness" is a real property of photons - perfectly consistent with physicalism.

                1.3.3.3.2.2.3.1.1. Con:
                All sensory experience has some degree of "qualitativenss" to it. If one utterly rejects qualia (immediate first-person experiences), one has no evidence for trust in science or its discoveries (such as photons).

            1.3.3.3.2.2.4. Pro:
            Even those who object to talk of non-physical realities can frequently be found implicitly supporting claims of moral truth, such as presenting alternative lists of the Ten Commandments [611], claiming that they are better (in an objective sense?) then Biblical morality.

            1.3.3.3.2.2.5. Con:
            Even our physical senses often don't point to an objective reality. This includes hallucinations, hearing someone's voice who isn't nearby, seeing a person in your peripheral vision that isn't there, feeling like something wet is touching you when really it's just cold, seeing faces in everyday objects/scenes, various optical/auditory illusions, etc.

          1.3.3.3.2.3. Pro:
          As Nagel [612] and Jackson [613] have famously argued, the actual experience of everyday sensations (colors, sounds, and other qualia [614]) can never be fully reduced to third-person, scientific claims about the objects / events being experienced.

          1.3.3.3.2.4. Pro:
          Materialists who behave morally are implicitly admitting that they have large areas of life in which their decisions are based on unfounded assumptions.

            1.3.3.3.2.4.1. Con:
            Moral relativism doesn't conflict with moral behaviour any more than believing taste in films is subjective conflicts with watching good films.

              1.3.3.3.2.4.1.1. Con:
              No one who claims that taste in films is subjective can coherently claim that there is such a thing as a "good" film. Similarly, materialists who behave morally cannot coherently claim that there is any such thing as genuinely moral behavior.

                1.3.3.3.2.4.1.1.1. Con:
                People who acknowledge taste is subjective call films "good" all the time, without contradiction - that this does not mean the film is "objectively" good is unspoken and assumed.

              1.3.3.3.2.4.1.2. Pro:
              People can and do watch films they consider good, and avoid behaviour they consider bad, without contradicting themselves or otherwise being stumped by the fact that their preferences are not "objectively" correct.

              1.3.3.3.2.4.1.3. Con:
              One may well conclude that such filmgoers were irrational if they demanded the forcible removal of certain films or seriously recommended prison for those who made or watched certain films—while declaring others mandatory. This, however, is common behavior in moral discussion.

          1.3.3.3.2.5. Con:
          This is a Sherlock Holmes fallacy [615]. No amount of evidence against something can support the truth of something else. If you have evidence that X did not commit a murder, it cannot be inferred that Y did commit the murder. In the same way, proving materialism false does not prove theism true.

        1.3.3.3.3. Pro:
        A majority of philosophers accept or lean towards physicalism [616].

          1.3.3.3.3.1. Con:
          The majority of philsophers are not experts in philosophy of religion. They should not be considered experts.

            1.3.3.3.3.1.1. Con:
            Materialism and physicalism do not belong to philosophy of religion, and philosophers of religion have no special claim to expertise on questions like the nature of consciousness.

          1.3.3.3.3.2. Pro:
          Notwithstanding the object-level question of which position is true, which position is "more well-supported" is about the state of the field, which expert consensus should be an even stronger indicator for.

            1.3.3.3.3.2.1. Con:
            It is often the minority position which is more well-supported, in that those with minority views are more apt to respond to the majority view, whereas the majority often ignores maverick views.

        1.3.3.3.4. Con:
        Materialistic religious arguments support the existence of God.

          1.3.3.3.4.1. Pro:
          Materialistic religion treats conceptual, metaphysical and abstract ideas such as the afterlife, divine beings and the narration of creation as physical facts, rather than seeing them as allegory.bahaiteachings.org [617]

            1.3.3.3.4.1.1. Con:
            "Religious materialism" as defined at that source is exactly contradictory to materialism [618]; supernatural beings which are not reducible to mundane atoms, such as a physically-existing angel, are the thing that materialism asserts do not exist.

          1.3.3.3.4.2. Con:
          These arguments insist that scripture can only be interpreted literally, in order for materialism and theism to be in concurrence.

          1.3.3.3.4.3. Con:
          Materialistic relgious arguments directly contradict widely accepted metaphors found in scripture.

            1.3.3.3.4.3.1. Con:
            Both positions support the existence of God.

      1.3.3.4. Pro:
      According to the nihilist viewpoint, God does not exist.

        1.3.3.4.1. Con:
        God can be subjective and still exist.

          1.3.3.4.1.1. Pro:
          Many argue that numbers and even "random" ideas have real existence (platonism).

            1.3.3.4.1.1.1. Con:
            Platonism [619] is not subjective. Platonists hold that abstract objects exist in a "third realm", not that they exist as subjective ideas. Subjectivism [620] as a philosophy holds that no external truths exist.

          1.3.3.4.1.2. Con:
          If God is subjective, then being "God" is not a property of the object, but intrinsically an ideal ascribed within the view of someone looking at the object from a certain prism.

          1.3.3.4.1.3. Con:
          The God of classical Theism is the uncreated creator of all created things. A god that is subjective is, by definition, a created thing. Thus the two definitions are completely incompatible.

            1.3.3.4.1.3.1. Con:
            That "creator God" does not exist, as creating requires time and there was no time before the big bang.

            1.3.3.4.1.3.2. Con:
            That "creator God" does not exist if the B theory of time [621] is true.

              1.3.3.4.1.3.2.1. Con:
              The B theory of time does not eliminate the need for a creator, who could have created and determined the entire course of history.

                1.3.3.4.1.3.2.1.1. Con:
                If the universe always existed (as per the b-theory of time) then it was not created.

            1.3.3.4.1.3.3. Con:
            It is compatible with the definition of God being "ultimate metaphysical being".

        1.3.3.4.2. Pro:
        If all things are metaphysically equal, there is no metaphysical ultimate or supreme.

          1.3.3.4.2.1. Con:
          Assuming that all things are metaphysically equal assumes naturalism, so this claim begs the question.

        1.3.3.4.3. Pro:
        The idea of a ultimate metaphysical being (and therefore it's mapping onto any thing) is subjective. God's existence is therefore purely subjective.

          1.3.3.4.3.1. Pro:
          Conceptions of ultimate beings can, and often do, differ between people and cultures.

            1.3.3.4.3.1.1. Con:
            Inconsistent concepts of God may show that some (or all) aspects of a given concept is incorrect. It does not show that no concrete object exists behind the concepts.

          1.3.3.4.3.2. Con:
          That persons subjectively perceive a thing, even in different forms, does not entail that the thing is *merely* subjective.

          1.3.3.4.3.3. Con:
          Just because an analysis is not empirical, doesn't mean it is subjective. Mathematical proofs are not empirical but are certainly not subjective.

            1.3.3.4.3.3.1. Con:
            This does not disprove that philosophical arguments aren't subjective.

            1.3.3.4.3.3.2. Pro:
            Many philosophical arguments use empirical evidence, for example, the Kalam cosmological argument.

        1.3.3.4.4. Con:
        From a nihilistic viewpoint, every argument is ultimately meaningless including arguments for nonexistence.

          1.3.3.4.4.1. Pro:
          "No philosophical claims are objectively true" is a philosophical claim. So it is either false, or not objectively true.

        1.3.3.4.5. Con:
        Nihilism, just as religion, is a viewpoint and does not provide any proof to the existence, or non-existence of God.

          1.3.3.4.5.1. Con:
          For something to be considered divine the attribution of meaning is necessary, which disproves the fundamental existence of divinity.

            1.3.3.4.5.1.1. Con:
            If God exists necessarily (which implies immutability) and eternally, then meaning has also existed necessarily and eternally in the mind of God, which provide divinity with its fundamental existence.

      1.3.3.5. Con:
      Philosophical arguments for the existence of God were made by people like Aristotle, Plato, Leibniz, and Einstein. The great intellect of these people and their contributions are without question. They were definitely capable of providing sound arguments for their beliefs.

        1.3.3.5.1. Con:
        Those largely were not referring to the God(s) of religion(s) but rather metaphysical philosophical thought which are would be misinterpreted to refer to something related to 'classical theism' or even classical polytheism.

          1.3.3.5.1.1. Pro:
          Pantheism [622] may be a partly fitting term for what they referred to, not classical theism.

          1.3.3.5.1.2. Pro:
          Einstein was not a Christian or theist [623], criticized the Bible [624], and described conventional religious belief as naïve.

    Cosmological arguments [625] support the existence of God.

      1.3.4.2. Pro:
      -> See 1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.

      1.3.4.3. Con:
      Just because cosmology says that there was a beginning doesn't entail the existence of an almighty creator. Cosmology is ever changing, and it's possible that, in the near or far future, humanity will discover the real cause of the Big Bang.

        1.3.4.3.1. Con:
        The "cosmological argument" refers to philosophical arguments about the existence of the cosmos, and is not directly related to the science of cosmology, so this is confused.

        1.3.4.3.2. Con:
        "Speculation" of what the future holds is not a coherent argument with regards to scientific method, nor does it dismiss The Creator as probable First Cause.

          1.3.4.3.2.1. Con:
          The argument is not about speculation as to what will be shown in the future but that, in cosmology, nothing or not much points toward an almighty creator – it does dismiss such as a "probable" first cause even though it may not dismiss such as a possible or potential first cause of our Universe.

      1.3.4.4. Con:
      Cosmological arguments do not support the existence of God as the existence of God has no explanatory power as it does not explain how God came into being or always existed and therefore has the exact same unsolved problem that question of the first causation of anything represents.

      1.3.4.5. Pro:
      The argument from composition [626] supports the existence of God.

        1.3.4.5.1. Pro:
        -> See 1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.1.

        1.3.4.5.2. Con:
        The argument presupposes that something non-composite and immaterial can cause something material to come into existence.

          1.3.4.5.2.1. Con:
          Given that the human mind is at least partially immaterial, non-material entities can cause material effects.

            1.3.4.5.2.1.1. Con:
            That the mind is even partially immaterial requires that physicalism is false. This is far from being established; a majority of philosophers accept or lean towards physicalism [627].

          1.3.4.5.2.2. Con:
          The argument does not "presuppose" that something non-composite and immaterial can cause something material to come into existence, but rather, argues that something non-composite and immaterial can cause something material. The difference is in assuming as a premise or in accepting as a conclusion.

        1.3.4.5.3. Con:
        Composition can be perfectly explained without the existence of God. Anything that can happen will happen, so it is possible for particles to randomly form atoms which can randomly form molecules which can randomly form chemical structures and so on.

        1.3.4.5.4. Con:
        Composition is a mental abstraction rather than caused by another entity.

          1.3.4.5.4.1. Con:
          Assuming the existence of a mental shift (and, therefore, a mind) is to assume the existence of a composite object (a human being who possesses a mind).

            1.3.4.5.4.1.1. Con:
            Obviously our understanding of our own mental abstractions will involve mental abstractions, that doesn't make them anything more than that.

              1.3.4.5.4.1.1.1. Con:
              If there is an objective "our" (or "me"), then there is at least one psychologically complex object. Almost certainly, this object is both physically and metaphysically composite.

            1.3.4.5.4.1.2. Con:
            Describing mental events requires only "cogito, ergo sum" - that such things as human beings exist is not required, so this is wrong.

            1.3.4.5.4.1.3. Pro:
            If there is any external world (presumably consisting of elementary particles), then the mind experiencing this mental shift is either an immaterial substance, or a composite object.

            1.3.4.5.4.1.4. Pro:
            The human mind is fundamentally complex. It contains various thoughts, emotions, and other traits. It is a clear example of a composite object, meaning that the idea of composite objects cannot simply be dismissed as illusory.

          1.3.4.5.4.2. Con:
          This would lead to the conclusion that human beings are not composite objects. That is, one's mind is divorced from any particular physical object (such as the brain).

            1.3.4.5.4.2.1. Con:
            The mind being divorced from any physical object does not follow from composition being a mental abstraction. This is just conflating separate meanings of what "not composite objects" could mean.

          1.3.4.5.4.3. Pro:
          For a composite object such as a clock, seeing the clock and not merely the component parts it is made of is a conceptual abstraction in the human mind, and does not reflect anything physically primitive

        1.3.4.5.5. Con:
        Changes can accumulate within a complex environment of interacting atoms and molecules. This explains how composites form naturally, not supernaturally.

          1.3.4.5.5.1. Con:
          Despite the numerous experiments [628], and even assuming the conditions in which they were preformed matched the conditions of the early earth (rather than favoring positive results), they all failed to produce life out of lifeless matter.

          1.3.4.5.5.2. Pro:
          If chemicals accumulating are inorganic, then this is an example of inorganic evolution. If they are organic, then this is an example of organic evolution. If they are molecules carrying mutable information inherited by a biological organism, this accumulation is an example of biological evolution.

          1.3.4.5.5.3. Con:
          These "natural forces" or "laws of physics" would then be the (intermediate) cause which keeps composite entities together. If the laws themselves are in some way composite, then they too require a cause. If they are not composite, then they are absolutely simple, which has been argued elsewhere to equate to God.

            1.3.4.5.5.3.1. Con:
            Natural causes are still natural causes regardless of whether they are composite natural causes or non-composite natural causes.

            1.3.4.5.5.3.2. Con:
            Simply because it has been claimed elsewhere that God is absolutely simple and implied that God is the only such being, does not mean that anything absolutely simple has been shown elsewhere to equate to God. Claims are neither proof nor evidence. They are claims.

        1.3.4.5.6. Con:
        Composite things are not "caused by" simpler things, but "composed of" simpler things.

        1.3.4.5.7. Pro:
        God is this absolutely simple or non-composite [629] cause of all composite things.

          1.3.4.5.7.1. Con:
          No justification is given as to why the argument determines that the non-composite entity is God.

          1.3.4.5.7.2. Con:
          There are zero scientifically validated examples of a thinking entity which is more simple than a hydrogen atom, which is a complex composite of subatomic particles. Therefore it would be ludicrous to assume from that claim that one could logically conclude such a hypothetical first cause to be capable of thought. Therefore, it could not be a God, at least in the classical theology sense.

            1.3.4.5.7.2.1. Con:
            God is immaterial. Science confines its study and its methods to only what portions of the material world are measurable. Therefore the lack of "scientifically validated examples" is irrelevant. It is like expecting a yardstick to be able to gauge what something sounds like. Science is the wrong tool for the job of analyzing God. Science is the right tool for analyzing His creation.

              1.3.4.5.7.2.1.1. Con:
              If there is no way to measure a god then there is no reason to believe a god exists.

          1.3.4.5.7.3. Con:
          To define a God of classical theology to be basically the simplest thing imaginable is to define away everything that defines it as a God according to classical theology. There are no known mechanisms by which an unchanging nondescript simple thing with no moving parts can accomplish anything at all. That's not a God. It's more like an infinitesimal neutrino field without even a neutrino. Basically as close to nothing as anything can be. You might as well say God is nothing.

            1.3.4.5.7.3.1. Con:
            Divine Simplicity [630] implies many of the other features of God:
            There can be only one absolutely simple thing. The absolutely simple thing must be unchanging (no potentiality). Something devoid of potentiality must inherently be immaterial, for material implies potential. Thus already we have Oneness, Unchanging, Immateriality, all common features of the classical definition of God.

            1.3.4.5.7.3.2. Con:
            Divine Simplicity [631] does not imply smallness. It actually implies immateriality which makes the concept of physical size inapplicable.

            1.3.4.5.7.3.3. Con:
            To be absolutely simple [632] is a very different thing from nothing. Existence is absolutely contrary to non-existence. There are no "gradations" of existence. Something either exists or it does not.

          1.3.4.5.7.4. Con:
          The argument does not claim that composite objects are caused by simpler things, but that they are caused by simple parts being held together by some thing or things outside of the composite object.

            1.3.4.5.7.4.1. Con:
            Then that claim would disagree with physics, since the forces which hold such composites together are carried by the parts.

        1.3.4.5.8. Pro:
        This [633] is another formulation of the proof of God's existence from the composition of things.

    1.3.5. Pro:
    The "argument from degrees [634]" supports the existence of God.

      1.3.5.1. Con:
      Traits such as beauty, nobility and goodness are subjective properties that different people rank differently, so there is no basis for expecting an objectively 'greatest' example of any such trait.

      1.3.5.2. Con:
      Truth, out in objective reality, is a binary thing; things are either true or false without degree. Degrees of truth appear in subjective probability, but therein the shared 'most true' facts are facts about the self, not some external entity which is somehow 'most true'.

    1.3.6. Con:
    The existence of arguments does not prove anything. It asserts something because someone supported it. It is hearsay. You have to show which argument you propose. This entire branch needs to be eliminated.

    1.3.7. Pro:
    Axiological arguments [635] support the existence of God.

      1.3.7.1. Con:
      In ancient societies that do not share the moralities of us today, even just being from the wrong branch of a particular religion could have gotten oneself killed.

        1.3.7.1.1. Pro:
        Most people would likely concede their viewpoint rather than give up their life.

        1.3.7.1.2. Pro:
        Religious wars happen only because religions exist.

          1.3.7.1.2.1. Con:
          Because it can be demonstrated that religion can exist without religious war, religion alone cannot be considered to cause religious wars.

            1.3.7.1.2.1.1. Pro:
            Instead we must analyse further and find a cause for religious wars in specific ideas or approaches to religion.

              1.3.7.1.2.1.1.1. Pro:
              The idea that God is not all loving and instead will torture for eternity anyone who doesn't take to the one true religion creates an internal logic which makes killing members of those religions reasonable because they are taking people to hell and preventing them from taking to one true religion, their only chance at salvation. youtu.be [636]

            1.3.7.1.2.1.2. Pro:
            India has a long history [637] of religious tolerance free from religious wars. It wasn't until the Muslim invasion that religious intolerance entered. Because religion can exist separate from violence it can't be claimed to cause violence. Specific fanatical ideas within religion however can be attributed as causes [638] of violence.

        1.3.7.1.3. Con:
        There always was an option to believe in God or not to believe in God. Atheism is not a new concept.

          1.3.7.1.3.1. Con:
          Discrimination against atheists has historically discouraged those questioning the faith of their peers from expressing their opinions.

      1.3.7.2. Con:
      The existence of God is not contingent on the value of that existence. This is an example of a moralistic fallacy [639].

        1.3.7.2.1. Con:
        This statement, while true, is not a con for the claim that axiological arguments support the existence of God.

          1.3.7.2.1.1. Pro:
          Axiological arguments are value-based arguments, but the vast majority of value-based arguments are predicated on the value of things, material and otherwise, which are not God. Therefore, the truth of the statement has no bearing, one way or the other, on the claim that axiological arguments support the existence of God.

        1.3.7.2.2. Pro:
        Morality does not factor into the existence, or non-existence of an entity.

          1.3.7.2.2.1. Con:
          If one accepts moral truth as in any way objective, then one is committed either to accepting it as a brute fact (an unparsimonious option) or to accepting that an entity is a causal factor in instantiating moral truth (hence, moral truth is evidence of a entity).

          1.3.7.2.2.2. Con:
          There would be no reason to be moral without the existence of a higher entity.

            1.3.7.2.2.2.1. Con:
            It may be that there is no reason to be moral; arguing for God's existence on the basis of how bad that would be is the fallacy of appeal to consequences [640].

            1.3.7.2.2.2.2. Pro:
            The word ‘reason’ is used intentionally here. Without a higher being, we can ‘explain’ moral behaviour through evolution or the social contract theory etc. But without a higher being keeping us accountable - providing we could get away with something and avoid punishment - there is no ‘reason’ to be moral.

            1.3.7.2.2.2.3. Con:
            Rational actors behaving 'morally' often achieve maximal combined utility outcomes.

            1.3.7.2.2.2.4. Con:
            Moral behavior is the product of instinctual psychological processes hardwired into humans from birth, so God is not needed for one to behave morally.

              1.3.7.2.2.2.4.1. Con:
              This is an explanation of our moral intuitions, but not a justification that our moral intuitions are correct.

                1.3.7.2.2.2.4.1.1. Con:
                To assume that our morals stem from God is stacking assumptions. In any case, many people disagree with God, and with other people. The God proposition doesn't answer the question of the origins of morality.

              1.3.7.2.2.2.4.2. Pro:
              The involvement of mirror neuron system [641] (MNS) is implicated in neurocognitive functions (social cognition, language, empathy, theory of mind) and neuropsychiatric disorders.

              1.3.7.2.2.2.4.3. Pro:
              Humans have physiological empathy-based [642] reactions when doing things that harm or help other people.

          1.3.7.2.2.3. Pro:
          Morality itself doesn't support or refute anything as a fact but rather provides an argument why one action should be taken above another.

            1.3.7.2.2.3.1. Con:
            This is an example of normative ethics, the discussion of what is right and what is wrong. The moral argument is an exercise in metaethics, the question of what moral statements mean and how they come to exist, which is very different.

      1.3.7.3. Pro:
      The existence of objective morality is evidence for the existence of God.

        1.3.7.3.1. Pro:
        Without a transcendent creator and arbiter which gives objective value to truth, there is no objective value to the pursuit of truth.

          1.3.7.3.1.1. Pro:
          Truth has no inherent value. Truth has value if and only if there is an arbiter of mankind which can give value to truth.

            1.3.7.3.1.1.1. Con:
            If we grant that truth has no inherent value, there's no reason why a God should be necessary or sufficient to change that.

            1.3.7.3.1.1.2. Con:
            Objective or subjective, my value of truth does not depend on anyone else's approval or validation to be legitimate and rational.

            1.3.7.3.1.1.3. Con:
            Truth has objective value due to it's nature of being able to predict future events.

          1.3.7.3.1.2. Pro:
          The discussion of whether God exists is not a question of the effectiveness practicality of the belief, but of the truth of the belief. Therefore, the discussion itself only has value if truth has value.

            1.3.7.3.1.2.1. Con:
            This discussion will be taking place whether it has value or not, so whether there is value to this discussion is not relevant to the discussion.

          1.3.7.3.1.3. Con:
          The objective value of truth can come from the utilitarian point of view (truth is valuable because it helps us in achieving our everyday goals).

            1.3.7.3.1.3.1. Pro:
            Science is inherently valuable because it works, and science needs to stick to truth in order to work.

            1.3.7.3.1.3.2. Con:
            Utility is a subjective property; a truth's utility to me is not the same as its utility to you. As such, the value of truth this provides is a subjective one.

          1.3.7.3.1.4. Con:
          If the value attributed to something were only subjective rather than objective, that's not an argument that the value is zero.

          1.3.7.3.1.5. Con:
          An alternative to divine truth could be consensus truth which would prevent this discussion from being rendered moot.

        1.3.7.3.2. Con:
        Being created for a purpose is not warrant for the goodness of that purpose. Building a gun to kill does not make it a moral good for that gun to fire and kill even though it does what it was designed to do.

          1.3.7.3.2.1. Con:
          A gun being built for murder and then being successfully used for murder does make it a correctly functioning, and therefore "good", gun, even if it doesn't justify the moral actions taken by the human using it.

          1.3.7.3.2.2. Con:
          Under this theory, manmade purpose isn't identical to morality, only Godmade purpose is.

        1.3.7.3.3. Con:
        Objective values do not exist. Human beings are the likely creators of values, including so-called "objective" values.

          1.3.7.3.3.1. Pro:
          In Plato's Socratic Dialogue "Euthyphro," it is proved that morality cannot feasibly come from a god, and thus must either exist or not independently.

            1.3.7.3.3.1.1. Pro:
            If God commands actions because they are right, then morality isn't grounded in God but instead supersedes him. But if actions are right because God commands them, then morality is arbitrary, as it is subject to the whims of God.

              1.3.7.3.3.1.1.1. Con:
              A thing is good because it's found in God's nature, and God wills things that are in his nature.

              1.3.7.3.3.1.1.2. Pro:
              According to the Euthyphro dilemma, something must be a part of God's nature because that thing is good, or that something must be good because it's part of God's nature. However, in the first case, the goodness derives from something outside of God's nature, and in the second case, God's nature becomes arbitrary.

              1.3.7.3.3.1.1.3. Con:
              God is unchanging, so morality is not subject to his whims.

                1.3.7.3.3.1.1.3.1. Pro:
                God never changed his nature to be what it is now. Instead, God has always had his current nature and has simply never changed it. Thus, his nature has not been shaped by his whims and is not subject to his whims.

                  1.3.7.3.3.1.1.3.1.1. Con:
                  It doesn't follow from the fact that he didn't change his nature that his nature is not subject to his whims.

              1.3.7.3.3.1.1.4. Pro:
              To determine that God is perfectly moral, an objective yardstick is necessary. However, the existence of such a yardstick would mean that God is not the measure of morality.

            1.3.7.3.3.1.2. Con:
            Euthyphro's dilemma could be applied to any objective moral standard: one could question why a moral standard is considered one in an infinite regress.

              1.3.7.3.3.1.2.1. Con:
              Euthyphro's dilemma [643] applies solely to divine morality, because it is premised on his supposed holy nature and perfect morality.

                1.3.7.3.3.1.2.1.1. Pro:
                The argument would not work with socially constructed morality: "Is an action wrong because society forbids it or does society forbit it because it is wrong?"

              1.3.7.3.3.1.2.2. Con:
              God is not the only source of objective morality. Instead, it can be defined based on outcomes, namely, the harm or benefits created for oneself or others.

          1.3.7.3.3.2. Pro:
          The mere existence of theories about morality does not imply their correctness and applicability to the real world. Although these views might govern the morality of a possible world, they do not account for morality in the real one.

            1.3.7.3.3.2.1. Pro:
            Moral theories do not make a claim to the authority of their ideas of morality. They merely suggest possible explanations to behavior that is already observable and operative in the world.

          1.3.7.3.3.3. Pro:
          The basis of most religions is morality, yet many different sects have completely different points of view (e.g. on abortion, LGBT people) and different systems (e.g. in Catholicism the current pope decides the church's views). The "geography" is an integral part of the journey. Some Catholics believe even non-Catholic Christians are destined for hell.

          1.3.7.3.3.4. Con:
          “The human mind has no more power of inventing a new value than of imagining a new primary colour, or, indeed, of creating a new sun and a new sky for it to move in.” C.S. Lewis - The Abolition of Man [644]

        1.3.7.3.4. Pro:
        C.S. Lewis [645] reasoned from universal experience that universal law exists and thus, a universal law-giver exists.

          1.3.7.3.4.1. Pro:
          The epistemology employed to perceive and prove the existence of moral truths (self-evidence [646]) can, with the same validity and epistemic strength, be applied to God's existence.

            1.3.7.3.4.1.1. Con:
            Absolute moral truths do not exist; therefore, their proof cannot be applied to God's existence.

              1.3.7.3.4.1.1.1. Pro:
              The morality of humans has changed over time and is dependent on their location, thus suggesting that morality is subjective.

            1.3.7.3.4.1.2. Con:
            Even if a proof of moral truths exists, that doesn't mean that that proof can be applied to the existence of God (with the same validity and epistemic strength).

              1.3.7.3.4.1.2.1. Pro:
              If they exist, moral truths and the existence of God would be in different categories of things. Moral truths are qualities of actions, whereas God is an entity.

          1.3.7.3.4.2. Pro:
          If moral judgments have objective truth, there must exist an objective standard or anchor point to justify them. Such a morally perfect, objective, rational, and transcendent anchor would be considered God.

            1.3.7.3.4.2.1. Pro:
            In order for morality to be objective, its source must also be objective and unchanging. The universe and all of its contents are contingent and therefore not objective. So it follows that the moral law-giver must be transcendent and necessary.

              1.3.7.3.4.2.1.1. Con:
              If morality is objective, it may exist without a source; there is no need to postulate another separate thing which is in turn sourceless, and call that separate thing God.

            1.3.7.3.4.2.2. Pro:
            The discipline of ethics shows that morality is considered a rational pursuit, that is that it requires reason to reach certain ethical conclusions. As such, any embodiment of the moral standard must also be rational.

              1.3.7.3.4.2.2.1. Con:
              Morality does not require embodiment, it just requires minds capable of reason to idealize those moral principles - thus it requires humans, not God.

                1.3.7.3.4.2.2.1.1. Pro:
                Humans often idealize behaviors, situations and objects and those idealizations don't need to (and perhaps never actually do) correspond to reality.

                1.3.7.3.4.2.2.1.2. Pro:
                The idea of a line does not correspond to anything real, it is an idealization based of real characteristics which are not a [perfect] embodiment of the concept of line.

                  1.3.7.3.4.2.2.1.2.1. Con:
                  An abstract line doesn't measure anything. It has no dimension of width or height. It's length is infinite, so it is rather useless as a standard of measurement.
                  
                  A meter stick on the other hand is useful precisely because it idealizes a standard for measurement.

                1.3.7.3.4.2.2.1.3. Con:
                Morality is not a list of rules, but a standard of behavior. Any standard is something by which another thing is measured, and must idealize the quality which it measures. Therefore, the moral standard must idealize the quality of behavior, which implies a person.

                  1.3.7.3.4.2.2.1.3.1. Pro:
                  You cannot measure the length of a line using color; rather, the standard used must have length. "24 blue" is meaningless with regard to the length of a line. "24 inches" is meaningful because the standard idealizes the quality of length.

                  1.3.7.3.4.2.2.1.3.2. Pro:
                  A standard is not subject to being measured in terms of the quality that it idealizes. In other words, it is illogical to say a meter is not a meter. It must be a meter by definiton.

            1.3.7.3.4.2.3. Con:
            If God is morality, then God can not choose what they do, as they must always do what is moral, and thus lacks libertarian free will, and is merely a force of the universe. As such, God would not be omnipotent, as they could not choose.

              1.3.7.3.4.2.3.1. Con:
              According to compatibilism [647], an individual will freely choose according to his nature. Therefore, given the same situation and the same individual, the same free choice will be made in all cases.

                1.3.7.3.4.2.3.1.1. Con:
                Compatibility would argue that a rock has free will, as it is not put under distress to make a choice, and that clocks choose what time they tell. Rocks do not have free will, and clocks do not make choices.

                  1.3.7.3.4.2.3.1.1.1. Con:
                  Free will is a quality only found in minds.

                    By either definition of free will, it is conceivable that it would cover true artificial intelligence if such a thing would be developed, as an AI is not a mind in the traditional sense, a mind is not a necessary condition of free will.

                      1.3.7.3.4.2.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
                      If such AI should be developed with all of a mind's faculties and fully independent it could be argued that it has a mind in the "traditional" sense.

                        1.3.7.3.4.2.3.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
                        It could be argued that an AI is just an over-complicated clock. Where the mind necessary for soft deterministic  free will begins is still a valid question.

                      1.3.7.3.4.2.3.1.1.1.1.2. Con:
                      No such AI has been developed yet. Until then, it is not safe to affirm that AI's can have a mind.

                        1.3.7.3.4.2.3.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con:
                        We can conceptualize such an AI, which is sufficient to judge whether or not they would be able to have free will.

                          1.3.7.3.4.2.3.1.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con:

                    In order to be able to make a choice, one must have certain qualities (such as consciousness, perception, thinking, judgement) essential to a mind.

                Compatibilism exists as a response to incompatibility, and answers the dilemma posed to them by changing the definitions of choice and free will.

                1.3.7.3.4.2.3.1.3. Pro:
                Free will [648] is the ability to choose between different possible courses of action unimpeded.

                  1.3.7.3.4.2.3.1.3.1. Con:
                  Harry Frankfurt has shown that alternate possible choices are not required for free will [649].

                    1.3.7.3.4.2.3.1.3.1.1. Con:
                    The Harry Frankfurt argument does not move to show that alternate possible choices are not required for free will, but instead argues that responsibility is not dependent upon choice. "The best definition, by his reckoning, is this: "[A] person is not morally responsible for what he has done if he did it only because he could not have done otherwise."" [650]

                  1.3.7.3.4.2.3.1.3.2. Pro:
                  The definition of free will doesn't include the need for different outcomes for the same individual in the same situation.

                  1.3.7.3.4.2.3.1.3.3. Con:
                  This view of  soft determinists, as coined by William James is nothing but an effort to create a quagmire of evasion by stealing the name freedom to mask it's underlying determinism. As Immanuel Kant pointed out, it is nothing more then wretched subterfuge, and jugglery. It is nothing more then attempting to treat the disease by masking, not treating, masking, the symptom.

                    1.3.7.3.4.2.3.1.3.3.1. Con:
                    Determinism isn't "underlying" in compatibilism, it is both admited and thought to be compatible with free will the way it has been defined.

                      1.3.7.3.4.2.3.1.3.3.1.1. Con:
                      The way it has been defined by compatablists, which is the way nobody else defines it. Pop-Culture is littered with examples of people exploring the concept of libertarian free will, or as they call it, free will, and how it conflicts with determinism, but nobody but compatablists uses the definition compatablitisest use.`

                  1.3.7.3.4.2.3.1.3.4. Pro:
                  Even under circumstances where people feel they do not have a choice, they do. A person with a metaphorical gun to their head, for example, can still choose to give in to the demand, fight their opponent, or do nothing.

                1.3.7.3.4.2.3.1.4. Con:
                As Ted Honderich explained, the mistake of the compatibilistic definition of free will is to assert that nothing changes as a consequence of determinism, when clearly we have lost the life-hope of origination.

                1.3.7.3.4.2.3.1.5. Pro:
                Compatibilism holds that for every individual there exists a hypothetical exhaustive list of preferences and tendencies called their nature, which is not freely determined by the individual (and thus determined by something external to them). That individual then wills (makes decisions) in a way that predictably follows from their nature and other data, and acts in a way that predictably follows from their will. It's unclear how any change to this formula would make an individual more free.

                  1.3.7.3.4.2.3.1.5.1. Pro:
                  The ability to contradict or determine one's own nature is what Plantinga calls maximal autonomy [651] - something that is both distinct from free will and, as he argues, logically impossible, since it would require an infinite regress.

                    1.3.7.3.4.2.3.1.5.1.1. Pro:
                    No mainstream philosopher - compatibilist or incompatibilist, determinist or indeterminist - argues that humans have maximal autonomy.

                  1.3.7.3.4.2.3.1.5.2. Pro:
                  The existence of a "nature" as a hypothetical exhaustive list of what an individual will choose is tautological - since any free individual makes choices, there must be a source for those choices. That source, whatever its properties, is what is called their nature.

                    1.3.7.3.4.2.3.1.5.2.1. Pro:
                    Importantly, an individual's nature doesn't need to be predictable, unchanging, known by the individual themself or anyone else, or even knowable in order for compatibilism to be valid. It only needs to exist in each moment and be the source of their preferences and tendencies.

                    1.3.7.3.4.2.3.1.5.2.2. Con:
                    If every source that could influence choice making is covered under the umbrella of nature, the parts that change one's nature must also fall under this umbrella, this doesn't resolve the problem of free will, it just moves it down from a discussion about the mind to one of nature.

                  1.3.7.3.4.2.3.1.5.3. Pro:
                  It's trivial that a hindrance to an individual's ability to act based on their will constitutes a reduction in freedom. If someone decides to do something, but is then restricted from doing so, then they are clearly not free. So being able to act predictably following one's choices is required for free will.

                    1.3.7.3.4.2.3.1.5.3.1. Con:
                    The entire argument of composition, besides semantics they invented to support their point, seems to be that if someone doesn't make a choice they were per-programed to make, they are not free. The ultimate, and certain example of soft-deterministic free will is not man, but the computer it so perfectly manipulate to serve it's needs, yet it is quite obvious that a human is freer then a computer.

                    An unpredictable being is uncontrollable, slight hindrances to the easiest route to a goal are nothing compared to avoiding being turned into a mindless gear in a machine.

                  1.3.7.3.4.2.3.1.5.4. Pro:
                  It's unclear how an individual would be freer if their choices didn't predictably follow from their preferences and tendencies (nature), combined with their thoughts, judgments, observations, physiological needs and desires, mood, etc.

                    1.3.7.3.4.2.3.1.5.4.1. Con:
                    Consider the instance when a entity without libertarian free will has weighed two options as equally good, and there is urgency, meaning there is no time for further evaluation, without the ability to make decisions outside of their evaluation, they would freeze, and take the usually worse default action, as we can make these decisions, we know libertarian free will exists.

                      The lollipop shown here [652] are all of 4 distinct, types, but otherwise entirely identical, and it's set up so that to get a lollipop, one must choose which lollipop they want, but the display doesn't cause confusion, people don't scan the lollipops for defects until they have ruled out all but one, they just make a decision, and go.

                        Even when choosing to pick blindly, the individual is choosing according to his nature given the external conditions.

                      We can see the ability to make decisions quickly as opposed to rationally that we developed to avoid dangerous indecision in the form of bad decisions, like impulse buys.

                        1.3.7.3.4.2.3.1.5.4.1.2.1. Con:
                        An individual being limited to choose either quickly or rationally is a false dichotomy. Many factors influence a decision (availability of time, emotions, personal preferences, affordability) even if the individual isn't concious of them at the moment.

                          1.3.7.3.4.2.3.1.5.4.1.2.1.1. Con:
                          An individual being limited to choose either quickly or rationally is only a false dichotomy when there is more then a split second to make a decision. Many, many events exist in which this is not the case, and our mind must be able to cope with them.

                            In these situations, there is not enough time to even subconsciously evaluate how much time there is to make a decision, but there might be time to review it if it is not a pressing matter.

                      1.3.7.3.4.2.3.1.5.4.1.3. Con:
                      The only thing that changes in the decision making process by adding urgency is the given conditions. The individual still chooses according to his nature given the external conditions (either by taking any of the options or doing nothing).

                    1.3.7.3.4.2.3.1.5.4.2. Pro:
                    Any obstruction in the predictability of their choices (given all the relevant data) would have to result from some external source (randomness, demonic possession, etc), not determined by the individual's will. The interjection of such an external source, though making the individual less predictable, would arguably make them even less free, since it would restrict their ability to choose according to their nature.

                      1.3.7.3.4.2.3.1.5.4.2.1. Con:
                      Saying that if a person makes a choice, it must be do to an external source, therefore they can't make a choice, therefore making a choice is impossible, is circular reasoning.

                        Librarian free will isn't librarian free will, in fact, libertarian free will directly contradicts the idea of libertarian free will, because the only possible way it could exist is if it somehow impeded part of the decision making process.

                      Under compatablism, the individual is nothing but an equation with the outside world as variable, every action is determined solely by external forces.

                        In compatibilism the individual's actions are determined by his own (internal) nature deciding upon the external conditions given.

                          Under compatablisum, what that nature is has been predecided. At best, it ignores the past, and calls the present free will.

                            this is a violation of the definition of free will, which requires the decision making process to be made at least partly without the influence of past experiences.

                      Under the branching model of the universe, every time there is an opportunity for a declension, the individual makes all decisions available to them, each choice making a new universe where the events are carried out, no external force needed.

                        In each hypothetic universe the same individual would only make one decision according to his nature in that universe. In other alternative universes that same individual's nature would be different and he would act acordingly in each one.

                    People's choices do very often follow from their preferences and tendencies, combined with their thought, judgments, observations, physiological needs, desires, mood. etc. but many times that only narrows it down to a set of options from which a choice must be made.

                  Compatibilism ignores the "make" part of "makes decisions", or 'makes choices', if these things were indeed made, then they did not exist before.

              1.3.7.3.4.2.3.2. Pro:
              Since God under this definition would be just a force, we could manipulate, and control them, as we do other forces, which would ultimately make us more powerful then God. If we can be more powerful then God, God can not be Omnipotent.

                1.3.7.3.4.2.3.2.1. Con:
                We don't manipulate or control other forces. For instance, we can only predict and work around gravity and electromagnetism, not change them - this kind of utilization certainly doesn't imply that we are more powerful than these forces.

                  We can defy gravity, or harness it for our own ends, gravity in turn can only gravitate. We are thus the stronger.

                  Not all things that lack libertarian free will are forces, some are objects, animals, or machines, but as morality is an ever-present entity that acts upon us, it, and thus, under this definition, God, must be a force.

                In order to utilize God in a way similar to electromagnetism He would have to be completely predictable in His actions. Lacking libertarian free will doesn't mean that something is completely predictable.

                    It is do in no small part to morality that out civilization has grown so expansive, so if God is morality, then we are already using God to our ends.

              If God's nature is identical to morality, then God is not compelled by anything, since morality is simply defined as "what God would do." Under this definition, the statement is "God must always do what God would do," which isn't a compulsion, only a tautology.

                  Free will only implies the freedom for one to act based on one's nature, not the freedom to defy one's nature. If perfect morality is a part of God's nature, it isn't necessary or expected that He be able to defy it.

When we read the story of Pandora's box, or Eve, and the Apple, we don't blink an eye, we empathise with the characters, because it's not outlandish, it is the natural result of a creature with free will.

                  Good is not defined as what God does, it's defined as what's in his nature. This makes the concept of good an objective and unchanging fact about the universe and therefore no more arbitrary than phenomena like gravity and magnetism.

              Without values, rationality only deals with what is, whereas morality is concerned with what ought to be/what we ought to do. It isn't possible to derive "ought"s solely from "is"s [660].

                Economics, as an example, derives what ought to be from what is valuable, and possible.

                  1.3.7.3.4.2.4.1.1.1. Con:
                  Economics relies on a presupposition of value (i.e. that property is valuable). The field itself is concerned only with how best to obtain what is already considered to be valuable, but doesn't compel anyone to give personal value to property.

                      This is still a presupposition of value, so economics fails to produce "ought"s with no presupposed "ought"s.

                        Value to the individual is objective, they have a need, and the thing they want can sait it, so this is an is, not an ought.

                Natural law [661], is a body of philosophical thought that derives ought (at least partially) from is.

                  Secular conceptions of natural law still rely on axiomatic "ought"s - for instance, that one ought not infringe upon another's rights.

                  All ethics is concerned partially with what is, using "is"s to supplement "ought"s and create more specific or complex "ought"s. However, no ethical system can successfully reach "ought"s without at least one axiomatic "ought" as its basis.

It is by every measure a failed moral system. As such, it has not derived real 'oughts'.

                  Morality being built upon prior observations of morality is circular - it attempts to ground morality in itself.

                    It was seen, then it was studied, once we saw it, we moved to figure out why it was, and how it worked, the observations are the starting point of moral studies, but not the bases of it.

                      Definitionally, morality is the means to determine what one should do. The statement "one should follow morality" is equivalent to "one should do what one should do," which is tautologically true.

              Different moral standards did not apply to different historical contexts. Even in the historical context of the 1850s where slavery was legal and widely accepted in the U.S., we are just as right in condemning slaveholders then as we are in condemning modern traffickers.

                Cultural relativism is supported by moral disagreements between cultures.

                The divide between cultures isn't clear or well-defined - as such, the decision of which cultural moral framework to follow would depend on overarching moral rules. Those rules separating cultures cannot themselves be decided by any culture, and as such, at least some objective moral standards would have to exist.

                1.3.7.3.4.2.6.2.3. Con:
                Under cultural relativism, the moral framework decided on by a culture is true, and anyone who defies it is morally wrong. However, we agree that certain figures such as Martin Luther King acted morally, even though they defied the moral framework of the culture they lived in. This is known as the reformer's dilemma.

            1.3.7.3.4.2.7. Pro:
            All attempts to generalize morality into uncontroversial and exceptionless broad rules have failed to match perfectly with our moral judgments. As such it seems likely that morality isn't simplifiable or reducible to general axia, and requires situational judgments. Therefore, if morality is objective, it must be contained in an external mind able to make such judgments - and such a mind would be considered God.

              1.3.7.3.4.2.7.1. Con:
              "It is wrong to torture small children for fun" is an uncontroversial and exceptionless broad rule.

                1.3.7.3.4.2.7.1.1. Con:
                A utility monster [667] could torture small children for fun and be morally justified.

              1.3.7.3.4.2.7.2. Con:
              If morality had to match human moral judgements perfectly, then where humans disagree on ethical dilemmas, it would have to match both sides of the disagreement at once and thus be self-contradictory. Thus, if there is an objective morality, it does not conform to human moral judgements, and thus could be composed of exceptionless broad rules with no need to be contained in a mind.

            Morality may not have "objective truth." This is demonstrated by the fact that people differ in their moral values and decision-making.

              1.3.7.3.4.2.8.1. Con:
              Disagreement on an issue does not indicate that the reality of the subject is not objective.

                1.3.7.3.4.2.8.1.1. Pro:
                The claim that objective moral truths exist and that we can perceive these truths does not require or imply that our perceptions are perfect. Disagreements surrounding moral issues can be attributed to failings in perceptions of objective moral truths.

                  People in different roles in society have different moral obligations. A doctor is expected to treat all patients equally, where as a police officer is expected to discriminate. A mother is commended for favoring her child while a school teacher would be condemned for showing favoritism upon the same child.

                Sometimes there may be more than one correct way to navigate moral dilemmas. For example, there are multiple ways to engineer a bridge which is stable and a similar thing can be true of moral issues.

                1.3.7.3.4.2.8.1.3. Pro:
                Moral issues are often complex being comprised of multiple differing principles all in tension with one another, therefore disagreement is to be expected as we struggle to come to mature understandings of how objective moral truths apply in specific cases.

              There are ontological implications for the existence of objective moral truth and they are fatal for naturalism because moral truths indicate a metaphysical layer of reality.

                The existence of a metaphysical reality and the subsequent death of makes the existence of God plausible.

                Naturalism and monotheism are not the only metaphysical views, so if naturalism were false that would not necessarily mean God exists.

          1.3.7.3.4.3. Con:
          The moral argument for God's existence is not sound as it presupposes that objective moral laws exist, which has not been demonstrated.

            1.3.7.3.4.3.1. Pro:
            In a theistic universe, laws are conceived entirely in the mind of God, and hence subjective. The only difference between God's subjective morals and human's subjective morals is that God has enough power to enforce his morals.

              1.3.7.3.4.3.1.1. Con:
              The unchanging and universal moral law still suffices as an explanation for our experience, even if it is "subjective" from the perspective of God.

              1.3.7.3.4.3.1.2. Pro:
              At least some of our morals are rooted in some goal, or valuable concept of value.

                1.3.7.3.4.3.1.2.1. Con:
                Opposition to a subjective goal is not an example of objective evil. The existence of activity which opposes some person's subjective goals would in no way be considered evidence for the non-existence of a classical theistic god.

                  1.3.7.3.4.3.1.2.1.1. Con:
                  There is no evidence to support the assumption that all forms of morality that don't really on God are subjective.

              1.3.7.3.4.3.1.3. Con:
              Lewis does not argue that God creates the law by His divine subjectivity or His will to impose them. That view is associated with nominalism and theological voluntarism, which Lewis rejected in favor of something more like Christian Platonism.

              1.3.7.3.4.3.1.4. Con:
              The argument that God's morals are subjective does not apply if God is of a different kind and mind than us. If we are created rather than begotten (that is being of different, more limited kind merely resembling the creator) then our perception of available morality is not going to be equal to that of God.

                1.3.7.3.4.3.1.4.1. Con:
                If God's morality is beyond our comprehension, even given our imperfect being, we must act on the information that we have, because it is the only information we have, and thus what God wanted us to see. If we see God's morality as subjective, it is God's will that we interpret it as such.

                  1.3.7.3.4.3.1.4.1.1. Con:
                  It is circular reasoning to assume our limited view and reasoning is God's will for our understanding of eternal truth... but our limited view and reasoning is precisely what prevents us from fully understanding eternal truths.

                    1.3.7.3.4.3.1.4.1.1.1. Con:
                    It is tautological to assume we know God's will without basis. This can be remedied either by denying God's existence, or assuming he desires us to know what we do. A third option does not readily present itself, so we should assume what we can deduce.

                Non sequitur; there is no more logical connection in "God is of a different kind and mind than us, therefore morality is objective" than in "the sky is blue, therefore the moon is made of stilton".

            1.3.7.3.4.3.2. Con:
            The existence of objective moral laws has been persuasively defended by many philosophers, including many philosophers who are not theists, such as Russ Shafer-Landau [668], David Enoch [669], and Michael Huemer. [670]

              1.3.7.3.4.3.2.1. Con:
              Just because some philosophers defend it doesn't mean it's true. This is an example of an appeal to authority [671].

            In support of premise (1), Lewis [672] argues that we all have within us the sense of right behavior and character. There is a sense of “oughtness” that presses upon us. He says, “human beings, all over the earth, have this curious idea that they ought to behave in a certain way, and cannot really get rid of it.” [Mere Christianity p 8]

              1.3.7.3.4.3.3.1. Con:
              The moral laws that apply to human beings should not be confused with a "Universal" moral law, which applies to everything.

                1.3.7.3.4.3.3.1.1. Con:
                Applicability to everything is not necessary for a law to be objective. The statement "water is a liquid at room temperature and sea level pressure" is objectively true, despite only applying to water. This type of objective truth is all that is necessary for the moral argument.

              Human beings all over the earth have conflicting ideas of how they ought to behave.

          1.3.7.3.4.4. Pro:
          For a universal Moral Law to exist, there must be a sort of 'order' in the universe. This order in the universe is what dictates humans acting/reacting according to the universal Moral Law.

            1.3.7.3.4.4.1. Con:
            Widespread disagreement in morality undermines the idea of "universal morality".

              1.3.7.3.4.4.1.1. Con:
              Scientific disagreement is also everywhere, but it doesn't follow from this that the outside world doesn't follow reasonable rules, only that some people are mistaken about scientific truths.

                1.3.7.3.4.4.1.1.1. Con:
                Scientific claims rely on observable, verifiable evidence. Moralistic claims rely on relativistic interpretation based on cultural references. Science is objective, whereas morality is subjective. 
                
                The outside world, and its rules, are neither all reasonable nor all unreasonable. It's a mixture of both. Filled with both objective scientific truths and a mix of subjective and often conflicting moralities, it follows that people would have trouble reconciling scientific truths and their faith.

              1.3.7.3.4.4.1.2. Con:
              Universal morality isn't required for the moral argument to hold, only that moral statements have truth value and things are objectively right or wrong.

                1.3.7.3.4.4.1.2.1. Pro:
                Morality can have objective truth even if no one knows of it.

              1.3.7.3.4.4.1.3. Con:
              Disagreement in morality often derives from factual, not moral, error. For instance, witch hunts were once conducted on the erroneous assumption that witches could have negative effects on others and the world.

                1.3.7.3.4.4.1.3.1. Con:
                While this is true, ethical disagreements can be elicited with thought experiments in which the facts of the matter are given and not in dispute, so factual disagreement can only explain some specific cases, and not moral disagreement on the whole.

                1.3.7.3.4.4.1.3.2. Con:
                The contentious issue of abortion demonstrates disagreement in morality.

                  1.3.7.3.4.4.1.3.2.1. Con:
                  The debate of the morality of abortion largely comes down to two points, one of which is clearly a factual disagreement, rather than a moral disagreement;
                  
                  Is the fetus meaningfully alive?
                  
                  The other question, which is debatable less factual in nature, is if a pregnant individuals right to choose outweighs the right to life the fetus may, or may not have, but many people consider rights to be based in facts.

              1.3.7.3.4.4.1.4. Con:
              Most general statements on morality are universally agreed upon by healthy societies. For instance, unjust murder is always considered to be wrong, as is thievery. Even if morality on the whole isn't universal, these general statements still require explanation.

              1.3.7.3.4.4.1.5. Con:
              The fact that people might disagree on a further point does not mean that originally they felt the same inclination towards agreeing with (or disagreeing with) that moral point. It could be (and probably often is) that a person convinces himself/herself of a particular moral point, thereby then finding evidential arguments for their holding of that moral view.

              1.3.7.3.4.4.1.6. Con:
              Disagreement about a concept "A" is warranted if and only if A actually exists. Therefore moral disagreement supports, rather than undermines, the idea that objective morality exists.

                1.3.7.3.4.4.1.6.1. Con:
                That disagreement exists does not mean the disagreement is actually warranted; two people arguing over "A" need only believe that A exists, and they may be wrong.

                1.3.7.3.4.4.1.6.2. Con:
                If each individual has a subjective morality, but that morality has rules for what other people should do, then disagreement when those perspectives clash is entirely warranted regardless of whether any such perspective has "objective" value.

              1.3.7.3.4.4.1.7. Con:
              Morality must be something more than shared human opinion. In 18th-19th century America, slavery was widely considered to be moral. If morality is merely "shared relative morals", then in their time and place, slavery was in fact, moral. Yet we rightly consider those persons today to have been morally flawed, even in their own time.

                1.3.7.3.4.4.1.7.1. Con:
                That we consider people in the past who endorsed slavery to have been wrong is itself nothing more than shared human opinion. That our opinions are not overruled by the opinions of long-dead others who we see as moral monsters, is no evidence that our opinions are more than opinions.

            1.3.7.3.4.4.2. Con:
            All morality is necessarily situational. Take a moral pronouncement and you can derive both a situation where it's justified and an alternate situation where it is not.

              1.3.7.3.4.4.2.1. Con:
              If there isn't a standard morality, then there is no need to qualify any action by its context, because all things would be acceptable across all situations.

              1.3.7.3.4.4.2.2. Con:
              Most theists reject moral absolutism (that certain actions are always either right or wrong, regardless of situation). Moral realism (that the rightness or wrongness of any given, situational action is objective) still holds, and is all that is needed for the moral argument to work.

              1.3.7.3.4.4.2.3. Pro:
              Moral relativism [673] holds that actions can be considered right or wrong, but that such a judgment depends on the context.

                1.3.7.3.4.4.2.3.1. Pro:
                Agent relativism states that the morality of an action can only be determined by the person taking the action.

                  1.3.7.3.4.4.2.3.1.1. Con:
                  Agent relativism isn't intuitive or held by many people - for instance, we still consider a murderer to be wrong, even if the murderer thinks that murder is morally permissible or even obligatory.

                    1.3.7.3.4.4.2.3.1.1.1. Pro:
                    Under agent relativism, since moral framework is decided entirely by the individual, individuals should be able to change their moral framework whenever it's convenient to them or they have a whim to. In reality, people don't treat morality as if it's subject to their own whims in such a way, and will deem it right to adhere to it even when it's inconvenient.

                  1.3.7.3.4.4.2.3.1.2. Con:
                  Agent relativism isn't supported by the human instinct to justify one's own actions based on moral standards. For instance, if someone steals, they will attempt to justify the theft by saying that they need the stolen thing more than the original owner does, rather than simply saying that stealing is morally right to them. This implies that morality is based on something outside of the agent.

                  1.3.7.3.4.4.2.3.1.3. Con:
                  Under agent relativism, morality is only motivated by internal beliefs, not by any external motivators. However, there are many examples of people's views of morality being changed by external motivators. For instance, imagine a man who believes that poor people deserve to suffer for the choices they make, but changes his mind after spending time with a poor family and coming to care about them. This scenario would not be possible under agent relativism.

                1.3.7.3.4.4.2.3.2. Pro:
                Speaker relativism states that moral statements are true or false only according to the one who makes the statement.

                  1.3.7.3.4.4.2.3.2.1. Con:
                  According to speaker relativism, when a claim is made, that claim is referring to the moral framework of the speaker. As such, when two people disagree about morality, they are speaking about two separate frameworks - and, as such, do not have shared meaning. Without shared meaning, real disagreement is impossible. Intuitively, this is not what moral disagreement is.

                    1.3.7.3.4.4.2.3.2.1.1. Pro:
                    If one person says that planes fly through the air, and another person states that they don't, believing the word "plane" to refer to a woodworking tool [674], then the two people don't truly disagree because they aren't referring to the same thing.

                  1.3.7.3.4.4.2.3.2.2. Con:
                  Speaker relativism isn't intuitive or held by many people. For instance, if someone says that murder is permissible, we intuitively believe that they are wrong, rather than just stating a truth about their own moral framework.

                  "Goodness" and "badness/evil" are irrelevant if they are only subjective constructions. One may consider something "bad", but be mistaken. For the argument to succeed, the action must be objectively bad. Objective moral values and duties cannot exist unless God exists.

                    Theists have long defended the concept of objective moral principles, distinguished from moral absolutism in that principles will require different behaviors in varied roles and situations. As such, a flat claim that a particular act must be "good" or "bad", regardless of context, is too simplistic a view of theistic moral claims.

                    Using the assertion that objective morality requires God to exist, to refute an argument that God is morally bad, doesn't in and of itself refute any argument that God is morally bad, so it just produces an internally-contradictory view of a God who is both evil and the foundation of good.

                    There can be an objective reason to say that the "good" of humanity is the ultimate good if we consider that humans are the only known creatures capable of reason. Since reason is the only way for the universe to know itself (as discussed by Carl Sagan), the fact that only humans possess it can justify a special status among living beings.

                  If morality is relative, then each person gets to decide what is moral. However, this renders each of us incapable of saying what is moral or immoral for someone else. Such a morality is incapable of informing us of how we should treat others--yet, how to correctly interpersonal relationships is a huge part of our moral framework.

                    Subjective morality does not prevent us from saying what is moral or immoral for someone else, it just makes that a subjective judgement rather than a judgement of what we subjectively believe to be objectively morally correct.

                    When a consistent moral relativist believes they have done something immoral, they can only mean that they have violated their own internal code. This raises the question of why they would ever believe any action (especially their own action) to be immoral to begin with. The value of a moral code that can only apply to oneself is questionable in the extreme. It is of little value to believe that oneself should behave in a given manner, while not holding others to any standard at all.

                      One needs no more reason to find one's own actions immoral than to dislike the taste of something one eats.

                      Believing in a God as a presupposition to justify using reason and logic is rationally worse that presupposing reason and logic directly. Occam's razor [677].

                      1.3.7.3.4.5.1.2.4.1.1.3. Pro:
                      Colossians 1:16 explains that the Christian understanding of God is that "by him [God] all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities—all things were created through him and for him."

                    1.3.7.3.4.5.1.2.4.1.2. Con:
                    If the Christian God exists, then our mental substance (whether material or immaterial) was created by God and when we exercise this mental substance to formulate arguments and thoughts we are borrowing from God.

                1.3.7.3.4.5.1.2.5. Pro:
                Whether an action is moral depends on who performs the deed. Soldiers can kill, police officers can arrest and lock people up, and doctors can cut open a person. If these actions were committed by others, they would be murder, kidnapping, and assault, respectively.

              1.3.7.3.4.5.1.3. Con:
              It is possible for an omniscient and benevolent being to do things which would be immoral for finite creatures because of His ability to see and guide all ends.

                1.3.7.3.4.5.1.3.1. Pro:
                Given the complexity of events, it is likely that the "bad" action is not actually the actually being taken by God, but is merely a logical consequence of a benevolent action taken by a being with much more far-reaching goals.

            1.3.7.3.4.5.2. Con:
            For a sentient being to recognize that some things are "good" and some are "evil" implies a recognition of a moral standard by which to distinguish between the two. Only God's nature is sufficient to be that standard.

              1.3.7.3.4.5.2.1. Con:
              Morals are, to at least some extent, evolutionary. As such, no standard is required.

                1.3.7.3.4.5.2.1.1. Con:
                God would be complete, therefore not evolutionary. The whole spectrum of possible evolutions of morals would be contained in God.

            1.3.7.3.4.5.3. Pro:
            Any interpretation of a God's actions would have to be made by humans, who are fallible. No person would be truly privy to the mind of God.

              1.3.7.3.4.5.3.1. Con:
              Human interpretation is, however, the filter through which we perceive everything. To dismiss such human ability is to dismiss - among everything else - the very possibility of knowing whether God exists and also whether God does not exist.

            1.3.7.3.4.5.4. Con:
            The good suggested by classical theism is the creator of the universe, and as such, would be an objective arbiter of morality unlike entities within the created universe which would only have a subjective view.

              1.3.7.3.4.5.4.1. Con:
              There is no reason why creating the universe would make one an "objective" arbiter of morality rather than just another subjective moral viewpoint, albeit one with tremendous power.

            1.3.7.3.4.5.5. Con:
            Human morality is subjective. An all-knowing god would be privy to all these subjective perceptions, so He can be objective.

              1.3.7.3.4.5.5.1. Con:
              An all-knowing God who oversees all things has the subjective perception of a being who sees all things. This is just another different perception of things, quantitatively more in what is seen but not any more objective in quality.

          1.3.7.3.4.6. Pro:
          Various basic human instincts such as responsibility (and other similar instincts such as gratitude and awe) are implicitly theistic.

          1.3.7.3.4.7. Con:
          CS Lewis's premise, "If there is a universal Moral Law, there is a Moral Law-giver," is unsubstantiated. Laws do not require lawgivers.

          1.3.7.3.4.8. Con:
          CS Lewis's premise, "If there is a moral law-giver, it must be something beyond the universe," is unsubstantiated. Laws can be from internal sources (e.g., laws passed by the parliament).

        1.3.7.3.5. Con:
        Humans would have morals regardless of God.

          1.3.7.3.5.1. Pro:
          Those that follow God-free, logic-based moralities are much better behaved, and consistent than theists do in no small part to fundamental foundational problems with theism.

            1.3.7.3.5.1.1. Con:
            Since the ability to determine whether a person who claims to follow some moral code actually does is limited to him being honest, there is no reliable method to evaluate what every person does in relation to the moral code he claims to follow.

            1.3.7.3.5.1.2. Pro:
            The horrible practice of the gospel of wealth [678] is an example of theistic indiscretion.

            1.3.7.3.5.1.3. Pro:
            Theistic sources are contradictory, allowing one to choose morals convent for them, rather then to be consistent, or good. For example, the bible argues both for [679] and against [680] slavery. It is impossible to be good when what is good isn't even consistently defined.

            1.3.7.3.5.1.4. Pro:
            Greater societal religiosity is associated with higher levels of "homicide, juvenile and early adult mortality, STD infection rates, teen pregnancy, and abortion" (p. 7 [681]).

          1.3.7.3.5.2. Con:
          To say that humans need God in order to know/understand morality is mischaracterizing the moral argument - that is a statement about moral epistemology (why we know about morality), whereas the moral argument is about moral ontology (why morality exists in the first place).

            1.3.7.3.5.2.1. Con:
            If a God is not necessary from the moral argument then the moral argument does not imply God's existence.

          1.3.7.3.5.3. Pro:
          Things like murder are wrong because it hurts the survival of our species.

            1.3.7.3.5.3.1. Con:
            If the only thing that makes murder wrong is because it "hurts the survival of our species," then failing to have a child is just as wrong as murder. This is because both actions result in one less person being in the population than would have happened without the action.

            1.3.7.3.5.3.2. Con:
            Without objective moral axia, there is no way to derive that we ought not hurt the survival of our species (i.e. that hurting the survival of our species is wrong).

            1.3.7.3.5.3.3. Con:
            The survival of our species is not a moral priority.

            1.3.7.3.5.3.4. Con:
            Eugenics and social darwinism help the survival of humanity by removing unfit genes. Forced conversion of homosexuals also helps human survival by increasing reproduction rate. Yet most agree that these actions are still morally abhorrent. Therefore, the survival of humanity is not identical to morality.

              1.3.7.3.5.3.4.1. Con:
              Social darwinism is not a moral framework that came out of evolution - rather it is a moral framework intentionally designed by people drawing on a parallelism with evolutionary principles.
              Conversely the moral framework that came out of evolution does take into account the well being of individuals.

            1.3.7.3.5.3.5. Con:
            It is not self evident why the survival of our species would be morally good without God.

      There are aesthetic arguments [683] for the existence of God.

        1.3.7.4.1. Pro:
        There isn't any reason a priori to expect the world to be fundamentally beautiful - however, if it was created by a perfect God, it would almost certainly be. As such, the fact that we exist in a fundamentally beautiful universe counts as evidence for a perfect Creator.

          1.3.7.4.1.1. Pro:
          In accordance with The Likelihood Principle, the existence of a fundamentally beautiful universe is likely assuming a perfect creator, and less likely assuming the absence of such a creator.

            1.3.7.4.1.1.1. Con:
            There exists in the claim a fallacy of Affirming the Consequent [684]. Allowing that God would probably create an ordered (a.k.a. "elegant") universe, it cannot be concluded that an ordered universe was necessarily caused by said God.

            1.3.7.4.1.1.2. Con:
            This demonstrates an argument from rarity [685]. It conflates the probability of causation with the plausibility of explanation. By analogy, it is like arguing that the winner of the lottery must have cheated, due to the low probability of any given person winning.

          1.3.7.4.1.2. Con:
          Much of the world isn't beautiful.

            1.3.7.4.1.2.1. Pro:
            Human beings and animals are capable of destroying life. This damages natural beauty.

              1.3.7.4.1.2.1.1. Con:
              The works that God is solely responsible for are fundamentally beautiful. However, his works are sullied by human beings and animals, to whom he gave free will, including the freedom to defile natural beauty.

              1.3.7.4.1.2.1.2. Con:
              Excluding these acts, the vast majority of the universe being fundamentally beautiful is very unlikely without assuming intentional design.

            1.3.7.4.1.2.2. Pro:
            The universe is not fundamentally beautiful - for example, life is impossible in 99.99% of the universe.

              1.3.7.4.1.2.2.1. Con:
              From a distance, the cosmos are extremely beautiful, though they are not capable of sustaining life. This does not induce fear, but awe.

            1.3.7.4.1.2.3. Pro:
            Natural disasters or infections are not works of free creatures, but they are not beautiful. Thus, if God exists, did not create a fundamentally beautiful universe.

              1.3.7.4.1.2.3.1. Con:
              Natural disasters may wipe out much moral evil, and so may have the beauty and awe of divine justice.

              1.3.7.4.1.2.3.2. Con:
              During natural disasters, many heroic acts are done, which are beautiful in their own right, and only possible in such dire situations; thus, natural disasters can be made beautiful by acts of heroism.

          1.3.7.4.1.3. Con:
          It's possible that the human conception of "beauty" adapted from experience of the outside world, and so it would be natural for humans to consider nature "beautiful."

            1.3.7.4.1.3.1. Con:
            Many things not visible to early humans - such as planets, nebulae, and galaxies, or the microscopic structures of many materials - are still considered beautiful, despite humans having no time to adapt to them and come to see them that way.

              1.3.7.4.1.3.1.1. Con:
              Our value of these other structures may be evolutionary spandrels [686].

        1.3.7.4.2. Pro:
        There is no particular reason a priori to expect natural laws to be elegant or beautiful, or even so accurately described by mathematics [687]. Yet, they are elegant and beautiful.

          1.3.7.4.2.1. Pro:
          The fundamental laws of our universe are extremely elegant, whereas the vast majority of possible sets of natural laws are incredibly arbitrary and complex. This suggests maximization by some agent.

            1.3.7.4.2.1.1. Con:
            Elegance in scientific theories is an illusion.
            We, as pattern finding masters, project the elegance into these equations and modify them to fit our aesthetic values.

              1.3.7.4.2.1.1.1. Con:
              We can't arbitrarily "modify the equations to fit our aesthetic values" because they still have to describe objective reality. If Newton's second law [688] were mathematically different (e.g F = ma + 0.001), there would be no way to legitimately simplify the equation into the much more elegant (and real) F = ma.

            1.3.7.4.2.1.2. Con:
            Proving the universe has a purpose or was "maximized by some agent" does not prove the existence of a classical theistic God. It merely proves the existence of "some agent", which does not need to be God, or that the universe has a purpose.

              1.3.7.4.2.1.2.1. Con:
              An agent that can maximize some quality about the universe would have to be transcendent and enormously powerful, if not omnipotent.

                1.3.7.4.2.1.2.1.1. Pro:
                Since some of the properties of a classical God are met, this argument can be considered to constitute evidence for classical theism.

          1.3.7.4.2.2. Pro:
          Intentional design by a perfect God could account for such elegance. As such, the fact that physical laws are mathematically elegant counts as evidence for a perfect Creator.

            1.3.7.4.2.2.1. Con:
            There is not sufficient evidence for intelligent design.

              1.3.7.4.2.2.1.1. Con:
              Elegance in the parent argument isn't being used in the aesthetic sense. It's not just pleasing to the eye, it's mathematically balanced and coherent.

              1.3.7.4.2.2.1.2. Pro:
              Aesthetics are subjectively pleasing, and something being found aesthetically pleasing doesn't necessitate it being made for personal appreciation.

          1.3.7.4.2.3. Con:
          A priori, by the Occamian principle, we should have every reason to expect simple (and therefore elegant, beautiful) sets of natural laws to be more likely than complex ones.

          1.3.7.4.2.4. Con:
          A complex and baroque set of natural laws, or even an ineffable and indescribable nature not governed by such laws, could just as well be seen as beautiful, so this beauty does not need explanation.

        1.3.7.4.3. Pro:
        If aesthetic judgments have objective truth, there must exist [689] an objective standard or anchor point to justify them. Such an aesthetically perfect, objective, and transcendent anchor would be considered God.

          1.3.7.4.3.1. Con:
          Aesthetic judgements do not have objective truth, and indeed the subjectivity of taste [690] is widely attested.

          1.3.7.4.3.2. Con:
          Many atheists have an aesthetic distaste for the idea of God; the description of God as "aesthetically perfect" is thus in dispute.

        1.3.7.4.4. Con:
        There is no thing necessitating objectivity in aesthetics. Indeed art, literature or any other thing that exhibits or conjures beauty is subjective in appreciation. One may fail to find beauty even where a billion others succeed, no known physical laws deny the possibility.

          1.3.7.4.4.1. Con:
          A difference in appreciation of art need not be grounded in mere difference of opinion. It may just as well be a consequence of some sort of defect in the one person over the other.

    1.3.8. Pro:
    Teleological arguments [691] support the existence of God.

      1.3.8.1. Pro:
      Something cannot posses categories of qualities which its source lacks. People exist; therefore, a personal God must exist.

        1.3.8.1.1. Con:
        Things can have qualities their origin doesn't.

          1.3.8.1.1.1. Pro:
          The concept of a chessboard has its origin in the human mind. Humans, and the human mind, do not possess the qualities of an 8x8 monochrome pattern of squares. Hence, chessboards are an example of something possessing qualities that its origin does not possess.

            1.3.8.1.1.1.1. Con:
            Proposing an intelligent mind as an example of something that can produce products possessing qualities which it does not have does not lend itself to atheism and naturalism. The parent poses it as an exception. If we grant that premise we haven't made progress towards atheism.

            1.3.8.1.1.1.2. Con:
            The ability of intelligent minds to create is dependent on them having been exposed to ideas and concepts which they later combine together in novel ways.

              1.3.8.1.1.1.2.1. Pro:
              One example of this is how it can shown that in music, movies and technology everything is a remix [692].

          Chemical reactions make compounds.

            1.3.8.1.1.2.1. Pro:
            Sodium Hydroxide and Hydrochloric acid together make water and salt, which have different qualities.

            1.3.8.1.1.2.2. Con:
            In chemical reactions, the type of elements and the amount of each don't change. They just join with new elements to make new compounds.

            1.3.8.1.1.2.3. Pro:
            Hydrogen and oxygen are each individually gases and do not possess any property of "wetness" or "potability". Yet, when appropriately combined, they produce water, which has the properties of being liquid, being wet, and being potable.

          1.3.8.1.1.3. Pro:
          Every electrical device have qualities that no individual part could do without the rest.

            1.3.8.1.1.3.1. Pro:
            The precursor to modern technology couldn't do the things technology can do now, such as use a touch screen.

            1.3.8.1.1.3.2. Con:
            The materials which something is made out of is not what is meant by source. The source of something means its creator. In the case of technology the creator is intelligent minds.

              1.3.8.1.1.3.2.1. Con:
              The creator of electronic devices cannot be used as an electronic device.

          1.3.8.1.1.4. Pro:
          Orange paint, when created by mixing yellow and red paint, has the quality of being orange, which its origin - yellow and red paint - does not possess.

            1.3.8.1.1.4.1. Con:
            Orange posseses a combination of the qualities of its origins. Orange is between red and yellow on the colour spectrum. If less red and more yellow is added the result will be closer to yellow and vice versa.

          1.3.8.1.1.5. Pro:
          Sand and water aren't hard or tall, but can make sandcastles with those properties [693].

            1.3.8.1.1.5.1. Con:
            Sand and water are both capable of being hard and tall, even without being assembled in the form of a sandcastle.

              1.3.8.1.1.5.1.1. Pro:
              Water, when cold enough, turns to ice which is a solid object.

              1.3.8.1.1.5.1.2. Pro:
              Individual grains of sand are hard.

            1.3.8.1.1.5.2. Pro:
            Water on its own will be flat with other parts of water, and a grain of sand doesn't stick well enough to other bits of sand, so the piles can't get too tall. But together, the water and sand stick together to bond the sand stronger and allow it to be taller before it collapses on its own weight.

          1.3.8.1.1.6. Pro:
          Intelligent life evolved from unintelligent matter.

          1.3.8.1.1.7. Pro:
          Thermal induction [694] produces heat. However, thermal induction does not contain the property of heat.

        1.3.8.1.2. Pro:
        Sunlight and heat come from the sun which has the qualities of heat and light.

          1.3.8.1.2.1. Con:
          The atoms in the Sun's photosphere which produce [695] the photons we receive as heat and light from the Sun do not have the quality of light themselves.

        1.3.8.1.3. Pro:
        A flower produces fragrance which has less qualities than the flower. The flower has form and smell, but the fragrance when carried by the air has only smell and no form.

          1.3.8.1.3.1. Con:
          If we are to regard a flower and its fragrance as separate things, then the flower as a separate entity does not have a smell, and hence the fragrance has a quality its source does not possess.

          1.3.8.1.3.2. Con:
          Odor originates from chemical substances, which are molecular structures. Therefore, odor does have a form.

        1.3.8.1.4. Con:
        This commits the fallacy of division, which is when one assumes that a property of a whole must apply to some or all parts of that whole.

        Mud comes from water and dirt. Neither water nor dirt are squishy. Things can possess qualities that their sources lack.

        1.3.8.1.6. Pro:
        Our experience and evidence indicate that meaning cannot arise from meaninglessness, order cannot arise from chaos, nor can design arise from purposelessness. In an atheistic reality where there is no ultimate meaning, order, or purpose, this must happen for meaning, order, and design to exist.

          1.3.8.1.6.1. Con:
          There are many examples of meaning arising from random processes.

          1.3.8.1.6.2. Con:
          "Meaning" is a subjective concept within human minds, it does not "exist" in external reality so, insofar as it does exist, it is constantly arising from meaninglessness (when humans read into the meaningless universe) and that's all that ever happens.

          1.3.8.1.6.3. Con:
          Order can increase locally in cases where energy is input from elsewhere (and thus entropy increases elsewhere); for example, biological evolution on Earth while the Sun is shining.

          1.3.8.1.6.4. Con:
          Design happens when a human has a purpose in mind and designs something. We have no evidence of anything truly designed that is not human-made, which is consistent with an atheistic reality.

            1.3.8.1.6.4.1. Con:
            It is extremely improbable for our universe to support life without God. Yet our universe has life, so it is designed.

      1.3.8.2. Pro:
      The complexity and precision found in nature and in living organisms indicate God's existence as the creator of all things.

        1.3.8.2.1. Pro:
        Life in our universe would be impossible [696] if any of a number of laws, constants, and initial conditions were changed even unimaginably slightly. This implies the strong probability that our universe [697] was created for the purpose of harboring life (fine tuning).

          1.3.8.2.1.1. Con:
          Life adapted to fit in the environment, rather than the environment being made for life.

            1.3.8.2.1.1.1. Pro:
            Fine-tuning arguments can be explained via multiverse theory [698], without resorting to God as the source of order.

              1.3.8.2.1.1.1.1. Con:
              Multiverse theory and anthropic reasoning can successfully explain why the laws of nature permit living beings to exist, but cannot explain why the laws of nature are so simple and elegant, since the vast majority of possible worlds with intelligent beings have extremely convoluted and arbitrary natural laws.

                1.3.8.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
                We only know about our own universe and therefore have no frame of reference for how simple and elegant our universe is.

                  1.3.8.2.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
                  Other sets of natural laws are conceivable, and those are often very complex. This is all that's required for them to be considered possible worlds under modal logic, which serves as our frame of reference to judge this universe.

                    1.3.8.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
                    if they are conceivable they are presentable, and they have not been presented.

                1.3.8.2.1.1.1.1.2. Con:
                Intelligent life living in a universe with less elegant and more arbitrary laws could just as well ask why they lived in a world with that specific arbitrary set of laws rather than another.

              1.3.8.2.1.1.1.2. Con:
              Multiverse theory attempts to resolve the origins of the universe by allowing random chance to compensate for the lack of a creator, but it fails to explain the source of the multiple universes. The question of a creator still remains.

              1.3.8.2.1.1.1.3. Con:
              No system has been proposed that would result in randomized laws, constants, and quantities in a multiverse.

                1.3.8.2.1.1.1.3.1. Pro:
                Although pseudo-random events seem to be common within our universe, due to unpredictable events and chaos theory, this would not apply outside of our universe without a similar system in place. We can't assume that randomness is the default state without reason.

                1.3.8.2.1.1.1.3.2. Pro:
                There is no theory in physics that explains how physical laws themselves would change or come into being, and so we have no basis on which to assume that this would happen at random in a multiverse.

                  1.3.8.2.1.1.1.3.2.1. Pro:
                  It could be argued that this would be outside of the jurisdiction of physics, since physics deals with the results of physical laws, not the laws themselves. No amount of understanding of physics can conclude *why* physics exists.

                  1.3.8.2.1.1.1.3.2.2. Pro:
                  By contrast to the multiverse, the god of classical theism would have the means to create and change physical laws due to its omnipotence.

                1.3.8.2.1.1.1.3.3. Pro:
                Perfect randomness may be a concept that could only exist within a mind.

                1.3.8.2.1.1.1.3.4. Con:
                This is false, as such theories have been proposed, for example, Steinhardt et al.'s cyclic models [699]. However, they don't need to be randomized, just changing in a way that allows adequate constants to arise.

              1.3.8.2.1.1.1.4. Con:
              If an infinite multiverse existed, then not only would implausible beings like Santa Claus and the Easter bunny exist, but so would every pagan/animist god and goddess. Therefore not only is a multiverse lower probability than virtually every religion, but belief in it entails beliefs in gods.

                1.3.8.2.1.1.1.4.1. Pro:
                There may be a world where God does not exist. Since God does not exist in every possible world, He does not exist.

                  1.3.8.2.1.1.1.4.1.1. Con:
                  Ontological arguments for God's existence and those for his non-existence demonstrate that God's existence is either necessary, or that his non-existence is necessary. Of these two options, God's necessary existence would be more plausible unless the definition of God can be shown to be incoherent.

                1.3.8.2.1.1.1.4.2. Con:
                Santa Claus and the Easter bunny are only implausible within our universe. Their existence in other universes, where they may be perfectly plausible and probable, doesn't count as evidence against the multiverse theory.

                1.3.8.2.1.1.1.4.3. Con:
                Pagan gods existing in causally disconnected universes are irrelevant to our lives, and as such their existence can be safely ignored.

                  1.3.8.2.1.1.1.4.3.1. Con:
                  Some of these gods may be very powerful and able to travel to different universes such as ours.

                  1.3.8.2.1.1.1.4.3.2. Con:
                  Depending on how disconnected they actually are, if they have followers in this world, they are influenced by these Gods, and warrant attention.

              1.3.8.2.1.1.1.5. Con:
              -> See 1.1.1.4.4.12.8.4.

            1.3.8.2.1.1.2. Pro:
            The universe is so unimaginably immense, has existed and will exist for such a huge amount of time that it's not statistically impossible for the conditions for life to exist at least at some point of the universe, at some period of time.

              1.3.8.2.1.1.2.1. Con:
              The argument from fine-tuning isn't concerned with the likelihood of life existing within the universe, but with the likelihood that the universe would exist in such a way that it permits life at all.

              1.3.8.2.1.1.2.2. Con:
              An unlikely event still requires a mechanism. Infinite time is only useful in having monkeys compose Shakespeare if the type writers have ink or if the moneys are bashing keys. There has never been a demonstration of how proteins could form before any protein existed.

                1.3.8.2.1.1.2.2.1. Con:
                It's not neccessary for life to be based on proteins, esspecially in world which would be different from our. Therefore for any universe's laws / constants etc. there could be some matter, which could create life.

                  1.3.8.2.1.1.2.2.1.1. Con:
                  This is shear speculation as there is no observational data to suggest it to be true.

                1.3.8.2.1.1.2.2.2. Con:
                Our organism is functioning on a basis of really probabilistic mechanism since cells are moving quite randomly and when they randomly appear in good place certain procces happens. It is somehow controlled for avoiding critical conditions and aiming good ones, but it's still higlhy probabilistic. Therefore even highly complicated mechanisms could work on probabilistic basis.

                  1.3.8.2.1.1.2.2.2.1. Con:
                  This con doesn't address the parents assertion that random chance can only bear fruit where a mechanism exists to throw the dice so to speak and that there has been no demonstration of how a protein could form before any protein existed.

                  1.3.8.2.1.1.2.2.2.2. Con:
                  The probabilities that govern biological systems sit within the range of likely events given the odds involved and the frequency and volume of opportunities for them to occur. This is converse to protein forming before protein existed which is neither statistically likely to occur, nor is there any explanation of how it could have a mechanism to arrange the proteins.

                    1.3.8.2.1.1.2.2.2.2.1. Con:
                    The process of the first formation of proteins was first explained over 50 years ago. [700]

            1.3.8.2.1.1.3. Con:
            The fine-tuning argument refers to constants and quantities that, if changed, would not allow for the formation of stars, matter, or complex chemistry, or else would result in near-instant heat death or collapse of the universe. It's clear that no universe such as these could support any form of life.

              1.3.8.2.1.1.3.1. Con:
              Our current understanding of physics partially supports this claim, however our current understanding is incomplete and physical behavior if the constants were outside the goldilocks zone can only be extrapolated based on our incomplete understanding.

              1.3.8.2.1.1.3.2. Con:
              The origin of these physical constants and the origin of the physical forces they apply to is unknown, there could be a common as yet undiscovered constant or variable controlling the values of these constants which can explain fine tuning without resorting to God.

                1.3.8.2.1.1.3.2.1. Con:
                Arguments hinging on evidence that may be discovered in the future are exceedingly weak. The claim could be made that it's possible we'll discover a faraway planet with the entire New Testament carved into its side, so God almost certainly exists. We can't investigate arguments like these because we don't have the hypothetical evidence in front of us.

                1.3.8.2.1.1.3.2.2. Con:
                Although a shared constant may lessen the amount of fine-tuning required, it would not eliminate it, since such a constant would itself be arbitrary and thus need to be finely tuned.

                1.3.8.2.1.1.3.2.3. Pro:
                The fine tuning could stem from the theory of multiple/infinite daughter universes posed by quantum physics: there could be a universe with any configuration of forces, and the chances are one of these would have the correct values for our observable universe to exist as it does, as unlikely as it is

                  1.3.8.2.1.1.3.2.3.1. Con:
                  This assumes that the values of the fundamental forces are assigned probabalistically, of which there is no evidence

                  1.3.8.2.1.1.3.2.3.2. Con:
                  This assumes that the daughter universes theory is true, which has no evidence

            1.3.8.2.1.1.4. Pro:
            DNA, RNA, and proteins [701] made up of the top four [702] most common elements in the universe, excluding noble gases, meaning life used what it had available to be made.

            1.3.8.2.1.1.5. Pro:
            Life could still have adapted to differences in the universe.

              1.3.8.2.1.1.5.1. Pro:
              There are other known sets of laws of physics congenial to life [703], that have significant difference to our own, including ones with an entire fundamental force missing and these lie in the tiny region of laws of physics we're able to conceive of and simulate.

            1.3.8.2.1.1.6. Pro:
            The low amount of life found in the universe so far suggests that it is not particularly hospitable to life.

              1.3.8.2.1.1.6.1. Pro:
              The universe does not appear to be fine tuned for life. It appears to be better tuned for making black holes.

              1.3.8.2.1.1.6.2. Con:
              In the context of this argument a hospitable universe is one that supports life, not necessarily produces life.

            1.3.8.2.1.1.7. Con:
            The purpose of the universe is the conclusion of the fine-tuning argument, not any of its premises.

            1.3.8.2.1.1.8. Pro:
            People are bad at understanding probabilities, and this is formalised as the Lottery Fallacy. The chance of me winning the lottery is astronomically small, but every week or so someone has a big win.

              1.3.8.2.1.1.8.1. Con:
              The problem of fine-tuning isn't based on popular understanding of probability, but on formal probability such as the Likelihood Principle and Bayes' Theorem. See here [704] for an in-depth explanation of the logic behind it.

            1.3.8.2.1.1.9. Pro:
            With an infinite amount of time (including whatever existed before time started), and an infinite number of universes, even low probability events become quite likely.

              1.3.8.2.1.1.9.1. Con:
              Claims that derive conclusions from infinite time and space are indefensible and overly dependent upon unverifiable assumptions.

              1.3.8.2.1.1.9.2. Con:
              -> See 1.3.8.2.1.1.2.2.

            1.3.8.2.1.1.10. Con:
            There is no contradiction between believing that the universe was fine-tuned to permit life to exist and that life arose naturally within the universe and adapted to its environment.

              1.3.8.2.1.1.10.1. Con:
              The fine-tuning argument's conclusion that the universe was created to support life is what is contradicted by the idea that life exist by the sheer size of the universe, and ability of natural adaption to occur.

          1.3.8.2.1.2. Pro:
          The numerous physical constants discovered by modern physics have made the fine tuning [705] argument more compelling.

            1.3.8.2.1.2.1. Pro:
            There are at least six finely tuned laws and constants [706] that make life possible in our universe: gravitational constant, cosmological constant, initial entropy, expansion rate and mass density of the universe, and the relative strength of electromagnetic force and gravity.

            1.3.8.2.1.2.2. Con:
            Claiming that something is 'finely turned' assumes someone tuned it, this is begging the question.

            1.3.8.2.1.2.3. Con:
            The number of physical constants and their seemingly highly unlikely arrangement for habitability of the Universe do not make the argument more compelling because, with a sufficiently large number of Universes – parallel, superimposed, or cyclical – and variations in these constants, the likelihood can be infinitesimally small and still be actual at one point.

          1.3.8.2.1.3. Con:
          We cannot calculate the individual probabilities of each combination of these parameters, so we cannot compare the probability of our universe to the other possibilities.

            1.3.8.2.1.3.1. Pro:
            For example, it could be possible that the elementary charge of the electron had another value that the one we observe in our universe. But we have no way to know which other values it could have had, neither the individual probability of each of these values.

            1.3.8.2.1.3.2. Pro:
            As there is only one universe, we will ever know about or examine, no notion of probability can be applied.

              1.3.8.2.1.3.2.1. Pro:
              Probability requires comparing against a space of alternative possibilities, yet we have no way to know that there are or could be alternatives since there is but one universe.

                1.3.8.2.1.3.2.1.1. Con:
                Alternative possibilities do not have to have actual existence or potential for probability to be relevant.

                  1.3.8.2.1.3.2.1.1.1. Pro:
                  In a deterministic universe, if a coin comes up heads the possibility that it could have come up tails does not actually exist, and yet it is still meaningful to apply probability to coin flips.

              1.3.8.2.1.3.2.2. Pro:
              Probability requires some notion of the distribution of the relative probabilities of the possibilities. Yet with only one data point (the universe as we know it) no justified estimate of the probability distribution can be educed and thus no justified estimate of probability can be made.

              1.3.8.2.1.3.2.3. Con:
              We can create simulated universes. One can argue that we have already simulated very simple simulated universes through cellular automata.

            1.3.8.2.1.3.3. Con:
            Knowing the exact probabilities is not necessary to intuit that they are very low.

              1.3.8.2.1.3.3.1. Con:
              Human intuition is not reliable for knowing about something that we do not have access to and have no idea about.

          1.3.8.2.1.4. Pro:
          Some interpret biological structuralism [707] to support a creator, as they argue it requires physical constants to be fine tuned to enable the life forms we see.

            1.3.8.2.1.4.1. Pro:
            According to process structuralism, biological systems would be a bit like crystals, in that they're likely to form and propagate wherever conditions are right (instead of only in individual, random circumstances).

            1.3.8.2.1.4.2. Con:
            Given what is known of the conditions for life on Earth, it is not possible to definitively claim that life would not emerge if conditions were different.

          1.3.8.2.1.5. Pro:
          The anthropic principle [708] favors theories that portray the universe as conducive to conscious life.

            1.3.8.2.1.5.1. Pro:
            The multiverse may be real and, by the anthropic principle, would explain why we observe a universe like ours.

              1.3.8.2.1.5.1.1. Con:
              Even in a multiverse scenario, it still needs to be explained why values for these constants that are life-permitting are actually possible [709].

                1.3.8.2.1.5.1.1.1. Pro:
                Leslie pointed out [710] that some of the finely tuned constants must each satisfy multiple constraints to have a life-permitting value, and it is highly coincidental that for each constant, these constraints all "line up," being completely satisfiable by a single value.

                1.3.8.2.1.5.1.1.2. Con:
                There already are some draft attempts to do so in cosmology and doing so is easier, more plausible and more in line with evidence than explaining the existence of a "God" whose cause of existence would also need to be explained.

            1.3.8.2.1.5.2. Pro:
            The many-worlds interpretation may be real, and, by the anthropic principle, would explain why we observe a universe like ours.

              1.3.8.2.1.5.2.1. Con:
              The many-worlds interpretation relates to quantum interactions within our own physics, and contains no mechanism for different physical laws or constants to arise.

            1.3.8.2.1.5.3. Pro:
            The universe may be cyclical or branching, and that, by the anthropic principle, would explain why we observe a universe like ours.

            1.3.8.2.1.5.4. Con:
            The anthropic principle (at least in a single-universe model) does not mean that fine tuning requires no explanation.

              1.3.8.2.1.5.4.1. Pro:
              In the analogy of Leslie's Firing Squad [711], one finding out that all the bullets missed and one is still alive does not make it irrational to wonder whether the marksmen missed on purpose.

                1.3.8.2.1.5.4.1.1. Con:
                In the case of us and the universe, "still alive" isn't an apt analogy. The analogy is more akin to our mother being put in front of the firing squad before we were born. Then, our existence requires that she survived.

            1.3.8.2.1.5.5. Con:
            The anthropic principle doesn't explain why we observe not just a universe that can be observed, but specifically one where scientific study of physics is possible and fine tuning can be observed. A universe with observers would still be unlikely to have this latter trait.

              1.3.8.2.1.5.5.1. Pro:
              If the laws of physics were not stable over time [712], physics would be much more difficult.

              1.3.8.2.1.5.5.2. Pro:
              The laws of physics are simple enough to apply in practice [713].

              1.3.8.2.1.5.5.3. Con:
              If the universe was chaotic enough that the scientific study of physics was impossible, theists would attribute humanity's continued existence despite that chaos to the grace of God, rather than inventing "fine-tuning"; thus an argument for God's existence that ignores the anthropic principle would exist either way.

            1.3.8.2.1.5.6. Con:
            The anthropic principle doesn't have any explanatory power.

              The anthropic principle explains why we observe a universe capable of supporting our existence. If the universe had not been capable of supporting our existence, we wouldn't observe it. Thus, it has some explanatory power.

              1.3.8.2.1.5.6.2. Pro:
              The anthropic principle, when used correctly, only applies to scenarios where there are many possible spaces observers could occupy, but only a few wherein observers could actually come to exist/survive. For instance, it's pointless to wonder why we find ourselves on a planet with liquid water, rather than another planet - if there were no liquid water, we couldn't exist. The same doesn't apply here, where no probability spaces other than our universe are known to exist.

                1.3.8.2.1.5.6.2.1. Con:
                If the universe is a one-off event, it is not coherent to apply probabilities to it, as it is incoherent to apply probabilities to one-off events.

                1.3.8.2.1.5.6.2.2. Con:
                There are good reasons to think there may be other universes.

              1.3.8.2.1.5.6.3. Pro:
              The ability to ask a question doesn't factor into whether the question is meaningful. I can ask why my parents got together, even though if they hadn't I wouldn't be able to ask such a question - there is still a meaningful explanation for their getting together.

                1.3.8.2.1.5.6.3.1. Con:
                The anthropic principle wouldn't explain why any particular parents got together to produce a particular child, but it would explain why the necessary preconditions were met for someone to be present to wonder about their origination.

              1.3.8.2.1.5.6.4. Pro:
              The fact that we can know a certain event happened only gives us certainty that it happened, not why it happened. The latter is what the fine-tuning argument is concerned with.

                1.3.8.2.1.5.6.4.1. Con:
                "Why do I observe the sort of universe I do?" is answered by the anthropic principle. Namely, that if the universe were significantly different, there wouldn't be anyone to ask the question.

          1.3.8.2.1.6. Pro:
          The constants referred to are dimensionless [714], meaning their value doesn't depend on any other value or measurement. It's unclear how these values couldn't be different.

          1.3.8.2.1.7. Con:
          Analogically, one could argue, "My existence in our universe would be impossible if any number of laws, constants, and initial conditions were changed even unimaginably slightly," implying that the universe was created for the purpose of harboring that specific person.

            1.3.8.2.1.7.1. Con:
            As a member of the set of "life", the argument is expected to apply just as well to you as to any other creature or to life as a whole.

            1.3.8.2.1.7.2. Con:
            A theist would typically agree that the universe was made for the purpose of hosting you, in a sense, since God has an individual purpose for everyone.

            1.3.8.2.1.7.3. Con:
            The reason the above statement suggests the universe is created is that there was only one "shot" (an assumption) at the universe and we got one that supported life - ie that we were exceedingly lucky. Your version is clearly different because there were many opportunities to have you or someone like you. Once we assume the human race, unlikely individuals existing is very likely (it is unlikely anyone will win the lottery but people often do). The two are different cases.

          1.3.8.2.1.8. Con:
          Conway's game of life [715] shows that life-like phenomenon can emerge from radical different "laws of physics." Most laws may pass the level of congeniality to life, and we just exist in an island surrounded by hostility.

            1.3.8.2.1.8.1. Con:
            Even if more than one life-permitting set of constants exists, they are still vastly outnumbered by non life-permitting sets. Thus, this does not help much to explain fine tuning.

          1.3.8.2.1.9. Con:
          Humans occupy 0.03% of the planet, and the remaining 99.97% is uninhabitable [716]. If the universe was created for the purpose of harboring life, it would be designed to accommodate more people.

            1.3.8.2.1.9.1. Con:
            This misunderstands the parent claim. It doesn't just say that the conditions appear "fine tuned" specifically for Earth, but that a small change in the constants would render 100% of the universe uninhabitable. The fact that we can live anywhere at all in the universe requires explanation.

            1.3.8.2.1.9.2. Con:
            It doesn't matter that most of the universe is uninhabitable; what matters is that the habitable portion is large enough to support humanity.

            1.3.8.2.1.9.3. Pro:
            Our galaxy is a very small portion of our universe, meaning that the majority of the universe is uninhabitable for humans. This suggests that the majority of the universe was not designed for life.

        1.3.8.2.2. Pro:
        If we apply inference to the best hypothesis to an attempt to explain the origin of the complex specified digital information found in DNA, we find an intelligent mind [717] is the only cause for which we have observational experience as minds are known to create information.

          1.3.8.2.2.1. Con:
          Just because DNA and other types of digital codes share one thing in common, information, this doesn't mean they share something else in common, an intelligent creator. This is commonly know as the false analogy fallacy [718].

            1.3.8.2.2.1.1. Con:
            The accusation of a false analogy is unjustified. For it to be a false analogy the differences would have to be more significant than the similarties. This is not the case with the coded information in DNA and that produced by human minds.

              1.3.8.2.2.1.1.1. Con:
              A false analogy [719] takes place when one asserts that since A and B have X in common, they also have Y in common, where A is DNA, B is a digital code, X is information and Y is a designer.

              1.3.8.2.2.1.1.2. Con:
              This is as invalid as stating that since DNA and other digital codes both have information and DNA looks like a ladder, therefore other digital codes look like ladders.

          1.3.8.2.2.2. Con:
          This is the God-of-the-gaps argument [720], as it says " we don't know how DNA came to be, therefore God made it come to be." Also known as an argument from ignorance [721].

            1.3.8.2.2.2.1. Con:
            It's not an argument from ignorance [722] in this formulation. It's an argument based on what we do know. It's an inference to the best hypothesis based on what we know about the cause and effect relationships capable of producing coded information.

              1.3.8.2.2.2.1.1. Pro:
              A God of the gaps argument would be one in which the claim is merely that a natural process could not have done it therefore God must have done it without any additional evidence or premises.

                1.3.8.2.2.2.1.1.1. Con:
                A god of the gaps argument states that since we do not know of an alternative explanation presently, God must be the explanation. God of the gaps does not involve the much stronger antecedent of rejecting all possible natural processes.

              1.3.8.2.2.2.1.2. Pro:
              In this form of the arguement an extra premesis has been added which states that we know intelligent minds are capable of producing information and we know of no other cause that has this capability.

                1.3.8.2.2.2.1.2.1. Con:
                Abiogenesis [723] is one possible explanation for the existence of DNA that is neither random chance nor an intelligent creator.

                  1.3.8.2.2.2.1.2.1.1. Con:
                  Abiogenises is not an alternative to chance because it relies on chance.

                    Abiogenesis is likely.

                      1.3.8.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro:
                      The universe, due to it's gigantic size, has a lot of habitable planets, meaning that the chance of at least one having life is likely.

                        1.3.8.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1. Pro:
                        If you roll 6 dices, the possibility of guessing all of them right is 1 in 46656. But if you roll the dice 46656 times you are likely to guess correctly at least once.

                        1.3.8.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.2. Con:
                        The statistical modelling allows for the size of the universe and large time spans and still it's mathematically implausible for life to come about by chance.

                  1.3.8.2.2.2.1.2.1.2. Con:
                  Abiogenises is unfalsifiable because although there is currently no explanation how it occurred it can never be proven that future findings won't discover one.

                    1.3.8.2.2.2.1.2.1.2.1. Con:
                    Abiogenesis is falsifiable - all the possible reactions in historical conditions could be explored to conclude that there is no natural route. The more such possibilities are rejected, the less promising the hypothesis. Regardless of whether it is a considerable project, abiogenesis is falsifiable.

                      1.3.8.2.2.2.1.2.1.2.1.1. Con:
                      If this is to be taken seriously then abiogenises can be considered falsified on the basis of the failure of every proposed explanation and the problems raised by a serious study of organic and synthetic chemistry.

                        1.3.8.2.2.2.1.2.1.2.1.1.1. Con:
                        Whether abiogenesis can be considered falsified only gives further support to the idea that abiogenesis is falsifiable.

                          1.3.8.2.2.2.1.2.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con:
                          This claim goes no where. If abiogenises has been falsified it should be rejected and if it is unfalsifisble it should also be rejected.

                        1.3.8.2.2.2.1.2.1.2.1.1.2. Pro:
                        James Tour [724] shows how given what we know now abiogenises is implausibe.

                          To the contrary, progress has been made [725] in this area of research, bringing science slightly closer to the answer.

                    Both an accepted and a rejected hypothesis of abiogenesis holds predictive and scientific value.

                    It is often claimed that unfalsifiable hypotheses have no scientific value. Abiogenises should be rejected by those who use this argument to reject intelligent design because they are both unfalsifisble in the same way.

                      It is not reasonable to present the opinions of scientists as something which should be accepted like some kind of scriptural decree. Rather the logic, evidence and work of scientists should be presented and assessed for its own merit. To do otherwise is to commit the appeal to authority logical fallacy.

            1.3.8.2.2.3.3. Con:
            It has not been demonstrated that a theory exists for which chance is not a critical component, so the accusation of a black and white fallacy is empty.

          1.3.8.2.2.4. Con:
          The following claim of the Stephen Meyer is provably wrong: "If you're a computer programmer, you know that if you start randomly the sections of functional code, you're gonna degrade that long before you come up with a new program or operating system."

            1.3.8.2.2.4.1. Pro:
            Genetic programming [746] offers a domain representation of programs in which every random change yields a new functional program.

            1.3.8.2.2.4.2. Pro:
            Genetic algorithms [747] involve random changes to programs which produce increasingly good programs as generations progress.

            1.3.8.2.2.4.3. Pro:
            Error-correcting codes [748] permit random changes to decode to functional programs, even if the number of such programs are relatively small.

          1.3.8.2.2.5. Con:
          Estimates [749] place the information contained in the human genome to only 4 MB. Algorithms produce novel digital information of greater complexity.

            1.3.8.2.2.5.1. Con:
            These algorithms don't mimic conditions which genetic mutations face.

              1.3.8.2.2.5.1.1. Pro:
              The mutation selection mechanism can only select for functional advantage [750]. Algorithms however, can select for changes which are closer to the desired result despite not offering any advantage yet.

                1.3.8.2.2.5.1.1.1. Con:
                Evolutionary algorithms almost universally select by fitness, i.e. functionality, not for closeness to a predefined code.

                  1.3.8.2.2.5.1.1.1.1. Pro:
                  The textbook Introduction to Evolutionary Computing [751] defines a general schema for evolutionary algorithms with selection only on fitness, and provides two examples where fitness is defined from function.

                  1.3.8.2.2.5.1.1.1.2. Pro:
                  This video [752] explains a simple evolutionary algorithm where selection is only on functional advantage.

                  1.3.8.2.2.5.1.1.1.3. Con:
                  The algorithm devised by Dawkins (1986) worked nothing like real evolution as it selected letter by letter, essentially having the entire sentence pre-specified. (P. 9, 2005 [753])

              1.3.8.2.2.5.1.2. Con:
              Whether algorithms mimic conditions is irrelevant to the claim that "the only cause in operation which can explain the origin of complex digital information is an intelligent mind"; as the claim deals with how such information could develop, not the particular conditions of the early planet.

            1.3.8.2.2.5.2. Con:
            Said algorithms are produced by humans so such an example is further evidence for the need of intellegent design.

              1.3.8.2.2.5.2.1. Con:
              Whether humans initially implemented the algorithms is irrelevant to whether the only known process requires intelligent minds.

              1.3.8.2.2.5.2.2. Con:
              Algorithms are processes that exist independent of human minds. Human minds can discover them.

              1.3.8.2.2.5.2.3. Con:
              Machine-learning algorithms develop novel code and results which the original developers did not intend.

          1.3.8.2.2.6. Con:
          There are evolutionary algorithms [754] which produce competent digital organisms with more information than the human genome.

          Given appropriate conditions, complex information develops with high certainty given sufficiently long time.

          1.3.8.2.2.9. Pro:
          DNA is a digital code where 4 nucleotide bases code for genetic information such as amino acid sequencing.

          1.3.8.2.2.10. Pro:
          Inference to the best hypothesis is a scientific method used for historical sciences [755] and employed by Darwin for his theory in which what we know from our uniform and repeated experience about cause and effect relationships is applied to events in the past in order to find the most plausible explanation.

          1.3.8.2.2.11. Pro:
          We know from our uniform and repeated experience that minds are capable of producing information.

          1.3.8.2.2.12. Pro:
          Observational data does not support the ability of random processes to produce information.

          1.3.8.2.2.13. Con:
          The way human cells work (and how DNA is copied) makes cancer possible. It is unlikely that god would intelligently create cells this way

          1.3.8.2.2.14. Con:
          Considering something as created, and therefore needing of a creator is begging the question circular thinking.

        Intelligent design is rejected by the scientific community as pseudoscience.

          1.3.8.2.3.1. Pro:
          Many scientific bodies [756] explicitly reject intelligent design.

            1.3.8.2.3.1.1. Con:
            Although various excuses are given for doing so, the arguments for rejecting intelligent design as a valid hypothesis ultimately stem not from science but from philosophy as the foundational premise of the arguments is founded in the belief in naturalism.

              1.3.8.2.3.1.1.1. Pro:
              Scientists lack training in philosophy and so their philosophical opinions should not be given credibility.

          1.3.8.2.3.2. Pro:
          A Pew Research Center poll [757] found that 97% of scientists believe that humans evolved over time.

                  Molecules in cells are always homochiral, whereas scientists are aware of no method, synthetic or natural, outside of living cells capable of doing this.

                  Organic compounds required for cells to form are highly unstable, and once formed begin to react with chemicals in the environment and get destroyed very quickly, making it so time, far from being helpful, is actually a kind of enemy,

              The Discovery Institute has a list [763] of scientists who doubt Darwinian evolution.

              1.3.8.2.3.2.2.5. Con:
              The reasons such scientists hold for their support do not rise to the level of evidence which convinces the vast majority of their colleagues, since you can not find articles supporting ID in reputable journals.

              1.3.8.2.3.2.2.6. Pro:
              The simulation hypothesis [764] holds that reality is simulated by an external being, which could be God.

                1.3.8.2.3.2.2.6.1. Pro:
                Some prominent minds, such as Elon Musk, believe in the simulation hypothesis [765], which suggests we may be more likely to be living in a universe made by an advanced civilisation than being the first advanced species.

                1.3.8.2.3.2.2.6.2. Con:
                There are good reasons to think a mind could not simulate a universe.

                  1.3.8.2.3.2.2.6.2.1. Pro:
                  The observer effect [766] implies that an uncollapsed wave-function could not exist in a mind.

                  1.3.8.2.3.2.2.6.2.2. Pro:
                  All known minds are based in physical substrates, and there is good reason to believe all minds would be. Thus, suggesting a mind is simulating the universe only pushes the question back to an unknown universe serving as substratum to that mind.

                    1.3.8.2.3.2.2.6.2.2.1. Pro:
                    Minds process information. But information requires some way to store it. A pure mind couldn't store information, as any stored information would entail something other than the mind.

                  1.3.8.2.3.2.2.6.2.3. Pro:
                  A simulation is a system that replicates certain desired features of another system without recreating it. A mind cannot replicate a system, but only imagine or consider one. Thus, a mind couldn't give rise to a simulation.

                1.3.8.2.3.2.2.6.3. Pro:
                The entity simulating our universe is God (theological idealism [767]).

                  The characteristics of a simulator run counter to the definition of a classical God.

                    God would not need a simulation of reality when he has the ability create reality.

                    1.3.8.2.3.2.2.6.3.1.2. Pro:
                    There could be multiple simulators, but this would run counter to the definition of a classical God.

                    1.3.8.2.3.2.2.6.3.1.3. Pro:
                    The simulator would not have the personal awareness of each human being that the classical God has.

                      1.3.8.2.3.2.2.6.3.1.3.1. Con:
                      At least in the case of "personal awareness of each human being", if the simulator's mind is running on hardware comparable to what it's using to run the simulation, there's no reason it couldn't have such extensive knowledge.

                    1.3.8.2.3.2.2.6.3.1.4. Pro:
                    The simulator might have finite computational resources, which would be incompatible with an omnipotent God.

                  There are three broad types of things that may be simulating our universe: a quantum computer in a universe such as ours (see Bostrom's ancestor simulation hypothesis), a classical computer in a classical universe, or a mind. We do not ultimately exist in either a quantum or classical computer, so we must exist in a mind.

                    1.3.8.2.3.2.2.6.3.3.1. Pro:
                    An ancestor simulation or other simulation within a quantum computer would have to exist in a quantum world very similar or identical to ours. According to the law of indiscernibility of identicals [768], if our universe is likely simulated, then any identical universe is also likely simulated. So any quantum simulation must itself ultimately exist within a mind.

                      1.3.8.2.3.2.2.6.3.3.1.1. Con:
                      Rather, what would follow is that the world is equivalent to its simulation, and thus positing anything beyond the world to explain it would be unnecessary. Thus, it undermines the simulation hypothesis itself.

                    1.3.8.2.3.2.2.6.3.3.2. Pro:
                    In order for a classical computer to simulate a universe it must contain as many states as the universe it is simulating, and thus be larger than it. A computer larger than our universe would be incredibly inefficient and impractical to build for any entity or civilization that isn't omnipotent. Therefore, we are not simulated in a classical computer.

                      1.3.8.2.3.2.2.6.3.3.2.1. Con:
                      A simulated universe/reality could be much smaller than the entire universe that we believe exists, such as a simulation of only our Solar System.

                      1.3.8.2.3.2.2.6.3.3.2.2. Con:
                      A simulated universe could drastically simplify many aspects of the universe if the simulators were not interested in them; most stars could be modelled as perfect spheres with the properties expected of those stars without us being any the wiser.

                    The simulation could be created by a species not that much more advanced than humans.

                      1.3.8.2.3.2.2.6.3.4.1.1. Pro:
                      Such a being wouldn't necessarily meet the classical definition of God (omnibenevolence, timelessness, simplicity, transcendence, immutability, etc).

                  1.3.8.2.3.2.2.6.3.5. Con:
                  Form fitting the term "God" to a system proven to exist does not make attached religious concepts of God true.

                    Any objectively provable "God" would disprove many if not most religious assertions about the nature of god.

                1.3.8.2.3.2.2.6.4. Con:
                The simulation hypothesis is an independent hypothesis from the god hypothesis, and it does not support or detract from it.

                  1.3.8.2.3.2.2.6.4.1. Pro:
                  The possibility of the universe being simulated has little to do with whether or not the simulator is 'God'.

                  1.3.8.2.3.2.2.6.4.2. Con:
                  Both hypotheses have far-reaching implications over an entire worldview if one believes in them, and for the hypotheses to be truly independent, those implications would have to (improbably) never interact.

                    1.3.8.2.3.2.2.6.4.2.1. Con:
                    This is conflating mutually exclusive hypothesis with independent hypothesis. Independent means one being true does not require the other to be true in order to be true.

                1.3.8.2.3.2.2.6.5. Con:
                The simulation hypothesis involves rationalising things outside the universe as if they were within the universe, there is no evidence to suggest this is valid.

                  Equally, there is no evidence to suggest that this is invalid, rendering this point moot.

                  1.3.8.2.3.2.2.6.5.2. Pro:
                  The simulation hypothesis is untestable.

                    1.3.8.2.3.2.2.6.5.2.1. Con:
                    Any 'higher being' hypothesis is likely to be fundamentally untestable. If you take an ant after giving it all the training in the world, it still wouldn't be able to solve algebraic equations. For us to be able to test the existence of God we would need to be able to comprehend God's existence, which, for our brains, may well be physiologically impossible. Being untestable for this reason is not a reason to reject the hypothesis.

                      1.3.8.2.3.2.2.6.5.2.1.1. Con:
                      The only higher beings a human can meaningfully hypothesise are those they can comprehend well enough to describe the hypothesis, which suggests they should not be so incomprehensible as to be untestable for that reason. Hence, we can reject such hypotheses for not being well put.

                Within a simulation, origin notwithstanding, a non-human designer may be omnipotent, omniscient, for all intents and purposes omnipresent, and perfectly benevolent.

                  1.3.8.2.3.2.2.6.6.1. Con:
                  They would not be omnipotent (even restricting it to the simulation), by example they would not be able to bring an arbitrarily large number of beings inside the simulation, because of the limited computational resources.

                    As the laws of physics in the parent universe may be different from our own, and we do not know them, it is possible that our simulator's computational resources are not limited.

                  1.3.8.2.3.2.2.6.6.2. Con:
                  Humans already don’t know what precisely go inside their own complex simulations. There is no good reason to think it would be different for the designer who created our world.

                    1.3.8.2.3.2.2.6.6.2.1. Con:
                    Instead of thinking about the computer simulations, consider fictional worlds, which may be regarded as a sort of conceptual simulation. With respect to a story, the author is easily considered to be omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent and timeless (outside of the time flow of the story).

                  1.3.8.2.3.2.2.6.6.3. Con:
                  If humans can act as omnipotent etc., and humans are not gods, it would follow that gods would not be needed to explain various facts within such a simulation.

                  1.3.8.2.3.2.2.6.6.4. Con:
                  This is begging the question. There is no reason provided to explain why a designer would be inherently benevolent.

                    God is God to me as Will Wright is God to the Sims; yet, even in that context, we'd be hard-pressed to call Mr. Wright omnipotent, omniscient, and omni-benevolent, even relative to the Sims themselves these attributes are vacuous.

                  They *may* be these things, but our universe does not appear as if it were designed or managed by one who is omnipotent and perfectly benevolent.

            1.3.8.2.3.2.3. Pro:
            Such an overwhelming consensus among educated experts is not decisive, but it does serve as strong indirect evidence.

          1.3.8.2.3.3. Con:
          This claim commits the logical fallacy called an appeal to authority.

            1.3.8.2.3.3.1. Pro:
            There was once a time when medical professionals rejected the need for hygiene. The fact that a majority of professionals held this opinion did not make it true.

              There was a time when the heliocentric model was rejected by scientists in a similar way. The popular opinion of authorities did not make it false.

                1.3.8.2.3.3.1.1.1. Con:
                This is not analogous to modern scientists' rejection of creationism, because no scientific community as understood in the modern sense existed at the time.

                  The first record of an editorial pre-publication peer review is from 1665 [769], and the first peer-reviewed publication was published from 1731. Insofar as the scientific method requires peer review, it can be said that there were no scientists around in Copernicus' lifetime.

            Reference to expert opinion and the scientific consensus is not logically fallacious.

              It can be justified if the subject matter, arguments and evidence is beyond the ability of non-experts to comprehend. For subjects with great consequence and which are comprehensible to lay people then it is prudent to ensure the scientists are representing good science well with the opinions in question.

                If the subject matter can be understood by the general public then the evidence and arguments should be presented and not simply and appeal to authority.

              1.3.8.2.3.3.2.2. Con:
              Critiques of Neo-Darwinian are not permitted in most universities. This is evidence that science has become dogmatic about the issue and has abandoned institutional disconfirmation in favour of an echo chamber.

            Scientists holding a certain opinion does not carry epistemic weight because scientists can be wrong, can be bribed, and can be swayed by peer pressure and institutional pressure. The epistemic weight rests in the evidence and reasoning which informs those opinions and we must look there in our quest for truth.

            1.3.8.2.3.3.6. Con:
            The claim is only offered as an indirect justification. Scientists are competent authorities in their fields and their judgment is of some value in assessing matters touching on their fields of competence.

          1.3.8.2.3.4. Con:
          The reason scientists reject intelligent design as a valid hypothesis is invariably motivated by prior philosophical commitments (a commitment to scientific materialism).

            1.3.8.2.3.4.1. Pro:
            Scientists also don't admit and often aren't even aware that they are making philosophical assertions making it an action done in cheating (because they call it science) at best and out of ignorance at worst.

            1.3.8.2.3.4.2. Con:
            Intelligent design as a hypothesis does not specify that the "designer" is God, or is even supernatural. As such, intelligent design is consistent with materialism, and so a commitment to scientific materialism cannot be the reason scientists reject intelligent design.

              1.3.8.2.3.4.2.1. Con:
              Intelligent Design has heavy theological implications which everyone in the industry is aware of, therefore commitment to philosophical materialism can motivate one against Intelligent Design.

          Convergent evolution [772] has been observed and is more likely under intelligent design than unguided evolution.

            It is very unlikely that unguided evolution would happen to create identical, complex features among unrelated species.

              1.3.8.2.3.7.1.1. Con:
              If the features are highly adaptive and as simple as possible, unguided evolution would predict that unrelated species could independently evolve it.

                Some examples of convergent evolution show a level of similarity that goes far beyond what would be necessary for the animals to adapt to the situation supposedly inducing the convergent evolution.

            It is less unlikely that an intelligent designer would decide to reuse traits across genetically unrelated species, resulting in these identical traits.

              Human engineers commonly [777] use standard parts in multiple different engineering projects, so it is plausible a designer might similarly use standard parts across his or her "projects."

            1.3.8.2.3.7.4. Con:
            Under intelligent design, all phenomena are designed and therefore equally likely, including our own comparison of intelligent design and randomness, so it then becomes impossible to decide what the likeliness of design is.

            In the absence of empirical evidence, the 'likelihood [778]' of an event cannot be determined.

            1.3.8.2.3.7.6. Con:
            Calculating the 'likelihood [779]' of an event requires someone to divide the favorable number of outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. If God is all powerful, then the total number of possible outcomes is infinite. No matter how large the number of favorable outcomes is, once it is divided by infinity [780], the likelihood comes to 0.

            Convergent evolution is not as unlikely as it might first intuitively appear because of extremely helpful traits and properties which emerge from certain kinds of organs or other evolutionary adaptions.

              As a sensory adaptation, echolocation [781] has evolved separately in cetaceans [782] (dolphins and whales) and bats, but from the same genetic mutations. (Excerpt from the Wikipedia page on convergent evolution [783])

              1.3.8.2.3.7.7.2. Pro:

          Arguments for design or the watchmaker analogy [785] are fallacies. Human design, which is the only design we know of, is inspired by nature and uses natural phenomenons. It's a sophistry to then conclude that nature is designed.

          The prevalence of DNA sequences which code for functional proteins is estimated [786] to be 1 in 10^64. This creates a search space too large for mutations to navigate in amount of time earth has existed.

            1.3.8.2.4.2.1. Con:
            This implies that random mutations occur with a uniform distribution across the available search space. It is reasonable to expect that environmental conditions accentuate which changes are likely to be occur, thereby reducing the breadth of mutations that will be observed to take place.

            1.3.8.2.4.2.2. Con:
            Multiple mutations may take place simultaneously [787] in different parts of the DNA, largely independent of each other, thereby reducing the number of generations required to observe the complexity or perceived sophistication of modern DNA.

          The similarity of DNA to computer code is a simile, not a metaphor [791]. Hydrogen and oxygen combine chemically in ways that cannot be realized using computer code, and thus chemical reactions cannot be used to conclude that God exists as a programmer or creator of DNA code.

            Given what we know of the world before, and after that point, this argument seems equivalent to the famous 'missing link' argument, while this is something we need to work on, it seems that in order for simple facts to be accepted by some, we must map out the location of every proton from the start of the universe to present.

            1.3.8.2.9.1.2. Pro:

              The video claims new proteins can't form via natural selection. This is false, as bacteria have to sometimes change proteins to earn antibiotic resistance.

                1.3.8.2.9.2.1.1.1. Con:
                The mutations required for antibiotic resistance to develop require a change of only 3 nucleotide bases. Statically this is to be expected. Adaptions requiring 6 or 7 changes of nucleotide bases are statistically implausible and a study [795] has shown they are unable to be produced in a lab.

                  1.3.8.2.9.2.1.1.1.1. Con:
                  Two separate mutations, each changing 3 nucleotide bases at a time would [796] add up to 6 changed nucleotide bases.

                    This only shows that it is possible for 2 separate mutations requiring only 3 nucleotide base changes to occur. It would not demonstrate changes requiring 6 or more changes.

              Claiming that "macroevolution" can't occur but "microevolution" can is like saying a 30 km trip can't be finished on foot because a foot is too small.

                This analogy is not fitting because macro evolution doesn't have a clear pathway like is suggested by the analogy. To make the analogy appropriate we need to extend it by adding pits, caverns and oceans. Michael Behe [798] shows in his book 'The Edge of Evolution [799]' how the limits of evolution are like gorges and oceans which cannot be traversed on foot.

          Paleontogical evidence suggests that phyla appeared in large numbers [801] out of nowhere and decrease in numbers as time goes by. While there are a small number of historical periods when phyla emerged, there are no fossils that support the alternative evolutionary hypothesis of gradual change.

            1.3.8.2.9.3.1. Con:
            The evolution of Phyla can support theories that are incompatible with God's existence, then it does not support the existence of God.

            1.3.8.2.9.3.2. Con:
            The absence of fossils does not prove the absence of ancient living beings gradually evolving. Their fossils may have been destroyed by natural catastrophes.

            1.3.8.2.9.3.3. Con:
            The Cambrian period lasted 53 million years, so is hardly 'out of nowhere'. 
            To give  an intuitive sense of how long this is, if the Cambrian explosion was as long as  a 100m athletics track, then for comparison Homo sapiens first emerged as a species 40-50cm away, and Jesus was born 4mm away (less than the thickness of Usain Bolt's running shoe sole).

            There are multiple [802] sources [803] which contradict the idea that macro-evolution is an unverifiable theory.

              Both sources are biased towards a particular outcome, and are thus unreliable.
              
              The BBC piece itself admits that current research methods into evolutionary science are yet incomplete to fully determine how distinct species can somehow transition into an entirely distinct species.

            1.3.8.2.9.4.2. Con:
            If you believe in microevolution then macroevolution is logical, as it's just microevolution over a much longer period of time.

              1.3.8.2.9.4.2.1. Pro:
              Macro and micro-evolution describe [804] fundamentally identical processes on different scales.

            1.3.8.2.9.4.3. Pro:
            It's generally thought that natural selection acts on isolated traits however natural selection acts on organisms not on isolated traits. This limits the ability of natural selection to select for traits because organisms have many traits and the combined impact of the other traits likely has more impact on the fitness of an organism then any single trait.

              1.3.8.2.9.4.3.1. Con:
              The selection process for applications to a mathematics course must act on students, not traits like mathematical ability, but we would nevertheless find that students at a highly competitive maths course are much better at maths than the average person on the street, suggesting that this kind of limitation on selection processes is not very limiting.

                1.3.8.2.9.4.3.1.1. Con:
                Yes math ability may be selected for in that example but traits which don't impact on math ability won't be selected for or against.

                1.3.8.2.9.4.3.1.2. Con:
                This is a false analogy because life is not as simple as a math course acceptance process. A more fit analogy would be financial success because as with evolutionary fitness, financial success is determined by a myriad of factors.

                  1.3.8.2.9.4.3.1.2.1. Pro:
                  Some with great math ability may be financial failures due to other traits held by the individuals, some may be successes due to their math ability and some may be successes due to unrelated traits held by the individuals. Natural selection is muddied in this way too because the net impact of all the traits an organism can outweigh the effect of any 1 trait.

                    1.3.8.2.9.4.3.1.2.1.1. Pro:
                    It's quite likely that financial success or failure is only determined by math ability in a small percentage of cases and even in these cases it is heavily influenced by the presence or absence of other traits.

              1.3.8.2.9.4.3.2. Con:
              This also means if an organism had multiple good traits and its brother had multiple bad traits, the first would be even more likely to have offspring than if it were just one trait. This would also mean when the second dies, more than one bad trait becomes less likely to reproduce.

            1.3.8.2.9.4.4. Pro:
            The overwhelming majority of possible gene mutations would offer no benefit, some of which would be deleterious and the vast majority of which would be nearly neutral. This makes it incredibly hard for random mutations to offer benefit.

              1.3.8.2.9.4.4.1. Con:
              This is one of the reasons why we evolved sexual reproduction [805], which produces more variation between generations and in a less deleterious fashion than mere random mutations.

              1.3.8.2.9.4.4.2. Con:
              That just means evolution would take a long time to offer benefit, which it does.

                1.3.8.2.9.4.4.2.1. Pro:
                Evolution is about the chance that a gene gets passed on. The chance means that if a species had a population of ten, had a 1/4 chance of surviving to adulthood, and had an average of four children, a gene that increased its survival to 1/3 would take an average of three generations before it means only one more offspring would survive to adulthood than usual.

            1.3.8.2.9.4.5. Pro:
            Macro evolution faces [806] major challenges as there are numerous examples of mutations having a limit to how far they can go before they become detrimental.

              1.3.8.2.9.4.5.1. Con:
              Evolution is not for the maximum, it's the bare minimum. Yes, mutations may or may not be detrimental, but once they become beneficial, natural selection then gets to act on it.

          1.3.8.2.9.5. Con:
          The creation story was not meant to be taken literally. It merely delineates the stages in creation.

            1.3.8.2.9.5.1. Con:
            This is just one interpretation. The fact that there are multiple interpretations is confusing, but the Bible says that God is not the author of confusion [807], so the creation story cannot be true.

          1.3.8.2.9.6. Con:
          Genesis 2:21-22 [808] describes how human beings were created, not what they looked like. Therefore, modern humans may have evolved from the first humans, who may have looked very different.

            1.3.8.2.9.6.1. Con:
            Humans are scientifically considered a different species to the primate ancestors we have evolved from. To further this argument, humans can trace their evolution back to fish [809]. Genesis 2:21-22 describes the rib being taken from a man, not a male of any other species which we may have evolved from.

            1.3.8.2.9.6.2. Con:
            Genesis [810] describes man being created from dust. Dust is silicate; humans are carbon. It does not follow that man is made of dust.

              1.3.8.2.9.6.2.1. Con:
              Dust can also refer to mud, which can contain carbon [811].

            1.3.8.2.9.6.3. Con:
            Genesis 1 [812] describes humans being made in God's image. Phylogenetically speaking, the first human that is our direct ancestor is Homo-erectus [813]. By the above logic, God would have a flat face, pronounced brow ridge, dark skin and an upturned nose. None of these features are depicted in Christian representation of God.

          1.3.8.2.9.7. Pro:
          The findings of Charles Darwin on evolution of species are heavily supported [814] and widely accepted by modern scientists.

          1.3.8.2.9.8. Pro:
          Skeletal remains of species from the homo genus eg. Homo Erectus [815] provide evidence of life forms which pre-date the oldest known skeletal remains of a human (Homo Sapien) [816].

          1.3.8.2.9.9. Con:
          The belief in the ability to scientifically describe everything, including miracle of birth or human soul, is again only a belief. Moreover, there are many areas of spirituality and other related topics, which science does not even try to approach. Most humans tend to manufacture arguments to fit their beliefs. It works the same for priests as scientists alike.

        1.3.8.2.10. Pro:
        The existence of Creation (The Planet, Sun, Moon, Stars, Oceans, Trees, Animal and ourselves), point to the existence of a creator.Infinitely complex beings and Systems cannot be the result of random processes, adding a large amount of time is still not plausible as an intelligent force need to be actively creating and sustaining things together (ex:Throw a needle 🪡 and thread 🧵 and wait for a 🧥coat to make itself).

          1.3.8.2.10.1. Con:
          A seed can grow into a plant without the intervention of anything with a brain, so the idea that an intelligent force needs to actively create and sustain things is obviously wrong even before natural selection enters the picture.

        1.3.8.2.11. Con:
        An existence which creates a vast space and some random species, make them fight each other. It is as foolish as it sound.

        1.3.8.2.12. Con:
        The existence of a complex system cannot be justified by referring to the existence of a significantly more complex being. This raises the question of the origin of the creator which is an infinite regress.

          1.3.8.2.12.1. Pro:
          The probability of a complex creator is much lower than the probability of a life-permitting universe with no creator.

            1.3.8.2.12.1.1. Con:
            Complexity does not necessarily reduce the chance of something simply existing without a creator. Informed theists argue that the universe was created not simply because it is complex, but for more specific reasons.

            1.3.8.2.12.1.2. Pro:
            The arguments related to the Ultimate Boeing 747 Gambit [817] provides some insight into why a complex creator is less likely than no creator.

          1.3.8.2.12.2. Pro:
          Many religions consider God to be omniscient,  omnipotent and omnipresent. Each of these qualities requires the God to be at least as much and possibly significantly more complex than the universe which is predicted, controlled or embodied by God.

            1.3.8.2.12.2.1. Con:
            God as classically defined is perfectly simple. Knowledge, power and location do not require complexity if they are absolute and unchanging. God is not relative to the universe.

              1.3.8.2.12.2.1.1. Con:
              A hypothesis about (eg.) "a mind containing X amount of knowledge, which is magically perfectly simple" is necessarily more complex than a hypothesis about "a mind containing X amount of knowledge", so defining God as perfectly simple is only a further complication for all relevant purposes.

          1.3.8.2.12.3. Pro:
          If one suggests that complex things need a creator, they need to explain why the creator doesn't need a creator; otherwise, they have created an infinite loop.

      1.3.8.3. Con:
      All forms of teleological arguments require "teloi" ("purposes"). Until its existence is proven, teleological arguments all fail until purpose is shown to exist.

        1.3.8.3.1. Con:
        Just like you can't prove or disprove the existence of logic, you can't prove nor disprove the existence of purpose. It's an argument that leads nowhere.

        1.3.8.3.2. Con:
        Artificial purposes exist, such as the purpose of an oven is to heat food.

          1.3.8.3.2.1. Con:
          Artificial purposes do prove an agent with intent, but artificial purposes do not assist a teleological argument. Natural purposes are required for teleological arguments.

            1.3.8.3.2.1.1. Con:
            Teleological arguments infer the intent of a particular agent, the hypothetical creator of the universe. It's unclear how anything more is required for the argument to work.

        1.3.8.3.3. Pro:
        Natural purposes do not exist. Assuming purpose to a natural thing, such as a rock, a tree, or a planet, assumes a creator to prove a creator.

          1.3.8.3.3.1. Con:
          Natural purposes do exist. The heart's purpose is to pump blood throughout the organic system. The blood's purpose is to distribute nutrients (and take waste) to/from the organic system. Without these real purposes, the organic system would cease to function. Thus, teloi (natural and unnatural) exist.

          1.3.8.3.3.2. Con:
          Assuming natural things do not have purpose assumes a lack of a creator to prove a lack of a creator.

          1.3.8.3.3.3. Con:
          This only shows that the assertion of natural purposes is fallacious, but it doesn't follow from that that it is untrue.

        1.3.8.3.4. Con:
        Not all teleological arguments assume intrinsic purpose, despite the etymology of the argument's name.

          1.3.8.3.4.1. Pro:
          There are many forms of teleology, including notions like purpose and meaning but also directedness, about-ness, representation, intentionality, function, final causality, and tendency, each of which may be utilized in independent and mutually reinforcing teleological arguments.

        1.3.8.3.5. Con:
        This cycles back to the original thesis of proof for God's existence and does not reach an end in itself.

        1.3.8.3.6. Con:
        Belief in purpose is properly basic, as it is part of human experience. To defeat it, is has to be shown to be faulty or illusory, rather than assumed to be. The burden of proof is on the person trying to disprove the validity of a (nearly) universal intuition.

          1.3.8.3.6.1. Pro:
          If the universe has no meaning, it would be impossible for humans to figure that out. Similarly, if light did not exist in the universe (and therefore creatures with no eyes), nobody would know if it were dark. Darkness would mean nothing. [C.S. Lewis [818]]

            1.3.8.3.6.1.1. Con:
            Physicists in a universe whose physics worked very differently and did not include light could hypothesise about universes that did and confirm that their universe was dark.

              1.3.8.3.6.1.1.1. Con:
              While physicists might be able to make calculations, they wouldn't be "imagining light and dark" or giving those words meaning. Compare the case with the much discussed knowledge argument in relation to qualia in the philosophy of mind (en.wikipedia.org [819]).

                1.3.8.3.6.1.1.1.1. Con:
                Experiencing the qualia of light and dark is not necessary to answer the basic question of whether there is light in the universe. Mary can tell you confidently that cherries are red, even if she doesn't know what that "really means" in some qualitative sense.

          1.3.8.3.6.2. Con:
          The perception of purpose is as common as the perception of taste, but this should not be confused with the intuition that this perception reflects objective purpose/taste, or with the actual belief that objective purposes/tastes exist, which need not be so common.

      1.3.8.4. Con:
      Not everything that exists has a purpose. Thus, the fact that some things have purpose cannot be generalized to all things that exist.

        1.3.8.4.1. Con:
        Just because we don't know if certain things have a purpose does not mean that they don't have one.

        1.3.8.4.2. Con:
        Some teleological arguments neither assume nor require that all objects exhibit teleology. These include arguments from intentionality [820], consciousness [821], and the Fifth Way [822].

        1.3.8.4.3. Pro:
        Vestigial organs [823] are defined as organs that have no known function.

      1.3.8.5. Con:
      Purpose is human-made, in that it is something one wants to achieve, so the definition presupposes a conscious agent, making teleological arguments circular.

      1.3.8.6. Con:
      The teleological argument for the existence of God is purely wishful thinking by people who don't understand what they're observing.

      1.3.8.7. Con:
      Teleological arguments based on the existence of specific things are nullified if natural explanations are discovered for those things.

        1.3.8.7.1. Con:
        The discovery of a natural explanation is irrelevant for the existence of a designer. In other words: The teleological argument is not nullified by such discovery. An explanation of a Ford car in terms of Henry Ford as inventor and designer does not compete with an explanation in terms of mechanism and law, as professor John Lennox [824] points out.

        1.3.8.7.2. Con:
        Here John Lennox's arguments [825] come into play. A natural explanation based on laws is unsatisfactory unless we know how those laws were put in place.

          1.3.8.7.2.1. Con:
          Equating cosmological constants to laws dictated by minds is a false equivalence. Natural "laws" are not dictated rules that must not be broken. They are observations about the natural world.

        1.3.8.7.3. Pro:
        Charles Darwin [826] refutes the Teleological Argument. "The old argument of design in nature, as given by Paley, which formerly seemed to me so conclusive, fails, now that the law of natural selection has been discovered."

          1.3.8.7.3.1. Con:
          A creator God could have planned the use of mechanisms such as natural selection in order to get the intended result. Thus the discovery of natural selection does not fail the argument of design.

          1.3.8.7.3.2. Con:
          -> See 1.1.2.5.4.

          1.3.8.7.3.3. Pro:
          Richard Dawkins refutes [827] the Teleological Argument. "Natural selection is so stunningly powerful and elegant, it not only explains the whole of life, it raises our consciousness and boosts our confidence in science's future ability to explain everything else"

            1.3.8.7.3.3.1. Con:
            The assertion that science will one day explain everything cannot be disproven and is therefore not a scientific claim according to many.

            1.3.8.7.3.3.2. Con:
            The mutation selection mechanism lacks the power to generate novel organs and body plans. This short comings in this theory are widely acknowledged by leading evolutionary scientists rendering the ideas presented above a myth and misinformation. youtu.be [828]

          1.3.8.7.3.4. Con:
          The Theory of Evolution doesn't cover the entire scope of the teleological argument.  Arguments like fine-tuning via the cosmological constant or nuclear force, the strength of gravity etc, cannot be answered by evolution, because evolution has organized matter as a presupposition, but without these features, there is no organized matter.

        1.3.8.7.4. Pro:
        The absence of a presently adequate explanation is not reason to assume there is no adequate natural explanation. Every explanation we currently have was true and adequate before we understood it.

          1.3.8.7.4.1. Con:
          The fact that natural explanations have been found for some phenomenon is not a reason to believe that all phenomenon will one day have natural explanations just as a cancer cure which works in many cases can not be considered effectice for every case . The only possible proof would be to establish natural explanations for everything.

          1.3.8.7.4.2. Con:
          -> See 1.1.10.9.4.4.3.4.

        1.3.8.7.5. Con:
        This argument does not follow because "natural explanations" and "teleology" are not mutually exclusive. Natural explanations can only answer the question, "How?" but teleology addresses, "To what end?"

        1.3.8.7.6. Con:
        So far such natural explanations have not been found (i.e. modern evolutionary theory and the precise assignation of the values of the fundamental forces)

      1.3.8.8. Pro:
      Arguments from consciousness [829] support the existence of God.

        1.3.8.8.1. Con:
        Materialism provides a satisfactory explanation of consciousness which does not require a God.

          1.3.8.8.1.1. Con:
          Materialism can only explain how the brain interprets the information gathered by our senses. It does not explain how the interpreted information could be perceived (consciousness).

          1.3.8.8.1.2. Con:
          As philosophers like Nagel, Levine and Chalmers have shown, conscious states cannot be identified with physical / natural states. Hence, conscious states are incompatible with physicalism/naturalism, though they are compatible with theism. Thus, conscious states give us reason to prefer theism over physicalism/naturalism.

            1.3.8.8.1.2.1. Con:
            As most philosophers are physicalists [830], Nagel, Levine and Chalmers do not seem to have sufficiently shown this.

              1.3.8.8.1.2.1.1. Con:
              Philosophers could be physicalist because they have a preexisting bias against theism, not because the arguments of Nagel, Levine, and Chalmers are unpersuasive.

        1.3.8.8.2. Pro:
        Adams (1992) and Swinburne (1979) argue [831] deductively from the disjunction  that mental events either have a personal or natural scientific explanation. Given that mental events are genuinely nonphysical, a personal explanation demonstrates the mental and physical event type correlations. If the explanation is personal, then it is theistic.

          1.3.8.8.2.1. Con:
          All personal explanations are, at root, natural scientific explanations. Thus, there is no genuine distinction between the two, and the argument collapses.

          1.3.8.8.2.2. Con:
          Mental events are thoughts, which are the product of mind, an emergent property of brain. They are very physical.

          1.3.8.8.2.3. Con:
          Deductive reasoning presumes accurate premises. The non-physical nature of 'mental events' is not a premise with any backing, thus nullifying the deduction.

        1.3.8.8.3. Pro:
        The ability to reason must be a dispensation from a higher being because it can't come from the arational.

          1.3.8.8.3.1. Pro:
          The Catechism of the Catholic Church (#47) [832] declares that "the one true God, our Creator and Lord, can be known with certainty from his works, by the natural light of human reason (cf. Vatican Council I, can. 2 § 1: DS 3026)."

            1.3.8.8.3.1.1. Con:
            This is circular reasoning.  An institution that depends upon the existence of god produces literature that self-verifies its own claims.

          1.3.8.8.3.2. Con:
          Evolution provides a mechanism by which the irrational can produce the ability to reason, without recoursing to an even higher ability to reason magically already existing.

            1.3.8.8.3.2.1. Con:
            The Evolutionary Argument Against Naturalism [833] shows that because naturalistic evolution would involve our reasoning processes being optimized for survival and not truth, there are no reasons to trust the ability to reason given naturalistic evolution.

              1.3.8.8.3.2.1.1. Pro:
              Plantinga's formulation [834] of the evolutionary argument against naturalism is compelling: Belief in naturalism and evolution lead to the conclusion that human cognitive faculties are unreliable. This undermines any belief produced by these cognitive faculties, including those in naturalism and evolution.

                1.3.8.8.3.2.1.1.1. Con:
                If someone has a defeater for the belief that his cognitive faculties are reliable, that would defeat rational belief in theism just as easily as rational belief in naturalism.

                  1.3.8.8.3.2.1.1.1.1. Con:
                  The other premises in Plantinga's argument show that naturalism would entail that one cannot rationally affirm their beliefs. However, they do not show that theism would entail the same thing. Thus, it may be possible to rationally affirm theism if theism is true.

                1.3.8.8.3.2.1.1.2. Pro:
                This claim can be supported using an argument from Bayes' theorem [835], which provides a formula for calculating the likelihood of an outcome based on new or additional evidence.

                  1.3.8.8.3.2.1.1.2.1. Pro:
                  For every true positive belief about a topic, there exist a vast number of false positive beliefs about that same topic. Thus, the vast majority of possible positive beliefs are not true.

                    1.3.8.8.3.2.1.1.2.1.1. Pro:
                    There is one true belief about the Earth's shape (the Earth is [roughly] spherical) and many false beliefs (the Earth is flat, the Earth is cubic, the Earth is a truncated icosahedron [836], etc.)

                    1.3.8.8.3.2.1.1.2.1.2. Con:
                    Some true beliefs only have one corresponding false belief (e.g. "Penguins exist" vs. "Penguins do not exist").

                    1.3.8.8.3.2.1.1.2.1.3. Pro:
                    There is one true belief about the number of states in the United States (50), but many false beliefs (1, 49, 309612, 4, 80, etc.).

                    1.3.8.8.3.2.1.1.2.1.4. Con:
                    The probability that a positive belief is true is not necessarily brought down much by the existence of a comparatively vast number of possible false positive beliefs. Thus P(T) being very low does not follow from the vast majority of possible positive beliefs being false.

                  1.3.8.8.3.2.1.1.2.2. Con:
                  This implicitly assumes that evolution selects for specific beliefs, i.e. that we are born with a hardwired list of things to believe are true. This is very unlike how human brains developed, and very unlike humans, so is not relevant to human rationality.

                1.3.8.8.3.2.1.1.3. Con:
                Someone could have other reasons for believing his or her cognitive faculties are reliable that counteract the negative effect naturalistic evolution has on this probability. (web.ics.purdue.edu [837])

                1.3.8.8.3.2.1.1.4. Con:
                Michael Bergmann [838] (p. 4-5) successfully explains how a person's belief can be justified through nonpropositional evidence, even if all the propositional evidence is against them. Thus, one can justifiably believe in the reliability of his cognitive faculties even if evolution makes this reliability unlikely.

                1.3.8.8.3.2.1.1.5. Pro:
                Evolution has poorly designed a number of bodily systems. Given this, we cannot be confident that it has designed our cognitive faculties well.

                  1.3.8.8.3.2.1.1.5.1. Pro:
                  The pharynx [839] is poorly designed in that it is used for both food and respiration, creating a risk of choking.

                  1.3.8.8.3.2.1.1.5.2. Pro:
                  Allergies [840] are arguably a design flaw in the immune system.

                  1.3.8.8.3.2.1.1.5.3. Pro:
                  Cavities [841] in teeth can often cause far more pain than cancer, despite cancer being far more serious.

                  1.3.8.8.3.2.1.1.5.4. Pro:
                  The laryngeal nerve [842] takes an unnecessarily long path under the aortic arch.

                  1.3.8.8.3.2.1.1.5.5. Con:
                  This seems to be a problem for theism too; if God designed many of our bodily systems poorly, we cannot be confident he designed our cognitive faculties well.

                    1.3.8.8.3.2.1.1.5.5.1. Con:
                    The key difference is that under theism, God plausibly created us so that we can know him and love him. Given this, God would prioritize giving us good cognitive faculties over all other goals, since these are most essential to achieving the goal of humanity knowing God. However, naturalistic evolution has no reason to prioritize good cognitive faculties over other features that help survival.

                  1.3.8.8.3.2.1.1.5.6. Con:
                  Cognitive faculties of a human scale differ from other evolutionary developments in that their accuracy is paramount to their being worth the immense energy cost of maintaining a relatively large brain and its support systems.

              1.3.8.8.3.2.1.2. Con:
              There is a vast difference between a process that is merely less than perfectly reliable, and a process so unreliable that nothing it says can be rationally believed, and the evolutionary argument against naturalism rests entirely on lazily equivocating between the two.

                1.3.8.8.3.2.1.2.1. Con:
                The argument claims that human beliefs have no evolutionary incentive to be even somewhat reliable, as long as the correct behaviors are performed, whether they follow logically from the beliefs or not.

              1.3.8.8.3.2.1.3. Con:
              Examples of poor reasoning or irrationality in humans are abundant, so it is clear that human minds are not optimised for truth and one can't escape from engaging with that fact just by attributing it to naturalism/evolution and then rejecting those.

                1.3.8.8.3.2.1.3.1. Con:
                It is true that humans exhibit poor reasoning sometimes, but the point of the argument is that under naturalism it is highly likely that such a large fraction of human beliefs (almost 50%) would be false that effective reasoning would be impossible. This is far worse than having, say, 5% of one's beliefs being false.

              1.3.8.8.3.2.1.4. Con:
              Given the great value of truth for survival (knowing whether it is true that there are lions in the cave, knowing whether it is true that this mushroom is poisonous, etc.), the truth-aptness of human faculties could reasonably be explained using naturalistic evolution.

            1.3.8.8.3.2.2. Pro:
            Given how advantageous it is to accurately perceive one's environment and make accurate inferences from one's available information, it is predictable that evolution will select for accurate perceptions and reasoning faculties.

          1.3.8.8.3.3. Con:
          "The rational" is not known to be able to produce the ability to reason, so this does not follow.

            1.3.8.8.3.3.1. Con:
            "The rational" does not need to be known to produce the ability to reason. Deductive arguments regarding a scenario with two proposed possibilities need only establish itself as such and prove one impossible to prove the other factual.

              1.3.8.8.3.3.1.1. Con:
              It's not unambiguously such a deductive argument, and in any case where the impossibility of the one scenario is not completely proven, the weakness of the case for the other scenario remains relevant.

                1.3.8.8.3.3.1.1.1. Pro:
                The ability to reason could come from a rational entity which is not a higher being, thus it is not a deductive argument with 2 possibilities.

                1.3.8.8.3.3.1.1.2. Con:
                That deductive arguments with two possibilities must disprove one possibility to prove another is irrelevant here.

                  1.3.8.8.3.3.1.1.2.1. Pro:
                  The con to the deductive argument in question claims that it is invalid because the claim does not follow from the premise it provides. If it is a deductive argument with two possibilities and it claims that one has been disproven, that only leaves one left and it doesn't matter that it is not commonly known to be possible.

                    1.3.8.8.3.3.1.1.2.1.1. Pro:
                    The only way to counter a deductive argument like this is to demonstrate that there might be more than two possibilities or to show that one possibility hasn't been disproven.

                  1.3.8.8.3.3.1.1.2.2. Con:
                  The whole claim is structured around the argument not being unambiguously deductive - that's already an implicit concession that it's irrelevant to a deductive argument, so going on about deductive logic is unnecessary.

          1.3.8.8.3.4. Con:
          Computers can perform calculations far more exactly and quickly and accurately than any human, yet computers are made of unintelligent, unreasoning parts. Thus, such abilities may be emergent.

            1.3.8.8.3.4.1. Con:
            Computers were designed by intelligent humans, and the alleged role of God is designer/creator not raw material, so this is a bad example.

          1.3.8.8.3.5. Con:
          The fundamental physical interactions which underlie the operations of the human brain are not irrational. They are either rational (proceeding according to certain consistent rules and descriptions) or arational (not proceeding from or by reason). What they are not is irrational (contrary to reason).

          1.3.8.8.3.6. Pro:
          As C. S. Lewis identified [843] arguing from reason that God doesn't exists means someone has to  "ask me to accept a conclusion while discrediting the only testimony upon which that conclusion can be based" because irrational processes can't produce the ability to reason.

            1.3.8.8.3.6.1. Con:
            Nothing about evolution is irrational, inasmuch as it is a perfectly understandable and self-sustained process. The ability to reason is just like any ability (to walk, use tools etc.), hence it is also a product of evolution. What is more, the terms 'rational' or 'irrational' more strictly apply to how humans assess things with their reason to be such or the other.

            1.3.8.8.3.6.2. Con:
            Material processes are not irrational (in the sense of being opposed or contrary to reason) but rather a-rational (not exhibiting reason). If it is possible that the rational can emerge from the a-rational, then the parent claim would fail.

            1.3.8.8.3.6.3. Pro:
            Humans, possessing the ability to reason, have the capacity to create other things with the ability to reason, like computers and artificial intelligence.

            1.3.8.8.3.6.4. Con:
            Evolution is the only thing that has been empirically observed that can produce reason, and the evolutionary process lacks any identifiable mind or rationality.

        1.3.8.8.4. Pro:
        Consuming DMT is a pathway to encounters with autonomous entities [844]. Following such experiences, one in two atheists no longer identify as such.

          1.3.8.8.4.1. Con:
          Drug-induced hallucinations are not a reliable form of evidence.

            1.3.8.8.4.1.1. Pro:
            Psychedelic hallucinogens induce varying results in different people.

            1.3.8.8.4.1.2. Pro:
            People under the influence of DMA have yet to create equally valid evidence while sober.

          1.3.8.8.4.2. Pro:
          The entity that one encounters following DMT consumption [845] is often perceived as God.

          1.3.8.8.4.3. Con:
          A person's ability to rationally assess and test whether one is actually interacting with an autonomous being would naturally be hamstrung while tripping off a powerful hallucinogen.

          1.3.8.8.4.4. Con:
          DMT induced hallucinations are not a good source of truth.

        1.3.8.8.5. Con:
        There's no need for any additional mystic or supernatural quality to explain the existence of consciousness.

          1.3.8.8.5.1. Pro:
          In The Emperor's New Mind <en.wikipedia.org [846]>, Penrose proposes a very plausible explanation for the apearence of conscioussness.

            1.3.8.8.5.1.1. Con:
            AI researchers, philosophers, computer scientists and other experts deny the plausibility of the thesis contained in The Emperor's New Mind [847].

          1.3.8.8.5.2. Con:
          Such a naturalistic consciousness would necessarily be deterministic, and any conclusions derived from that consciousness would be the product of naturalistic biochemical reactions and non-directed processes; more akin to a cosmic Plinko game than rational thought. 
          
          If true, then the conclusion reached in the parent claim should not be assumed to be true, as the claimant could not have come to any other conclusion regardless of the evidence.

            1.3.8.8.5.2.1. Con:
            Evidence is linked biochemically to thought, via reactions in photoreceptors in the eyeball and so on, so one would come to the same conclusion "given the same evidence", not "regardless of the evidence".

            1.3.8.8.5.2.2. Con:
            Natural biochemical reactions are not deterministic, they derive from a great deal of chaos and randomness.

              1.3.8.8.5.2.2.1. Con:
              "Chaos" and "randomness" in a naturalistic universe merely imply that too many variables exist to be tracked by humans or our tools. Neither chemistry nor physics are random; they behave according to well-established principles which permit us to understand our universe using the tools of science.

              1.3.8.8.5.2.2.2. Con:
              If the parent claim is true, then consciousness is the product of chaos and randomness, and would produce random thoughts, not rationality. Therefore our reason could not be trusted.

            1.3.8.8.5.2.3. Con:
            The fact that no supernatural explanation is required does not mean that such consciousness is deterministic. Quantum mechanics are not supernatural and are not deterministic

              1.3.8.8.5.2.3.1. Con:
              It has not been shown that quantum events are non-deterministic. Some interpretations, such as the De Broglie–Bohm theory, have deterministic implications.

          1.3.8.8.5.3. Pro:
          AI investigation will eventually be able to explain the rise of conscioussness.

            1.3.8.8.5.3.1. Con:
            This is not only speculation, it is a "science of the gaps" argument. In other words, "we don't understand this, but someday, science will be able to fill in the gaps of our knowledge".

            1.3.8.8.5.3.2. Con:
            In The Emperor's New Mind [848], Penrose proposes that consciousness can never be modeled by a Turing machine. This includes modern AI systems.

    1.3.9. Con:
    Philosophy is not a reliable means to test the existence of God.

      1.3.9.1. Con:
      Philosophical arguments which originated during early human history, especially from career philosophers were in fact cogent and sound [849], and have contributed to the understanding of logic ever since.

      1.3.9.2. Pro:
      Philosophical evidence is down to interpretation depending on whether you believe in the evidence or not. The existence of God is purely down to the individual.

        1.3.9.2.1. Con:
        This is drifting into radical subjectivism. If applied consistently, it would undermine belief in all knowledge. Though problems with interpretation exist for any area of knowledge, some claims are more reasonable than others.

      1.3.9.3. Pro:
      Philosophical arguments are mostly theoretical, and not empirical.

        1.3.9.3.1. Con:
        A field being theoretical does not mean evidence from that field should be ignored.

          1.3.9.3.1.1. Pro:
          Mathematics is a largely theoretical, but still important, field.

        1.3.9.3.2. Con:
        Science and philosophy overlap, but they don't provide a clear answer [850] regarding the existence of God.

        1.3.9.3.3. Con:
        The parent claim assumes that philosophical arguments are "lesser" than empirical arguments, because they are theoretical. This argument is similar to a reverse slippery slope fallacy.

          1.3.9.3.3.1. Pro:
          Advancements in science have proved "verifiable" theories that became empirical false in the face of new evidence; therefore, we should not view a philosophical argument as less valid than an empirical argument based solely on the fact that the philosophical argument is currently only theoretical in nature.

        1.3.9.3.4. Pro:
        Philosophical arguments can support anything that you want to be true by using the right words and rhetoric. For example, God can be defined such that the conclusion is always ''God exists."

          1.3.9.3.4.1. Con:
          The observation that a definition is tailor-made in some way does nothing to show that the definition is a bad one, or that an argument is unsound.

          1.3.9.3.4.2. Con:
          The tacit assumption seems to be here that since God is defined as such, therefore the definition is haphazard. This simply does not follow logically.

          1.3.9.3.4.3. Con:
          An analogous argument would be that since accountants and frauds both use numbers but have different outcomes, therefore mathematics is unreliable. This obviously does not follow.

          1.3.9.3.4.4. Con:
          The fact that dishonest arguments exist does not preclude the duty to deal seriously with honest arguments.

          1.3.9.3.4.5. Con:
          Whether or not one feels that the word "God" should be defined in a particular way, this is not a reason to dismiss these arguments. If a being, so defined, has been shown to exist, the argument is a success and knowledge has been gained.

            1.3.9.3.4.5.1. Con:
            This is only true where the arguments of one known to manipulate can be analysed for logical fallacy.

            1.3.9.3.4.5.2. Con:
            The words of an any argument can be phrased to mean one thing which may be true, but presented in a way which leads the audience to an opposing conclusion.

          1.3.9.3.4.6. Pro:
          Masters in such discussions in ancient Greece were called sophists [851].

          1.3.9.3.4.7. Con:
          Philosophical arguments are often confused with rhetorical arguments. Sophists were masters of rhetoric, they were not philosophers. Rhetoric can be used to support unsubstantiated claims through use of fallacy, philosophy contrarily relies on internal and external consistency, and therefore excludes fallacy.

        1.3.9.3.5. Pro:
        More things are plausible than true. Supporting something with a philosophical argument is not the same as establishing its likelihood of actually being true.

          1.3.9.3.5.1. Con:
          Many philosophical arguments do not merely establish possibility but yield likelihoods or can be amended to yield likelihoods.

          1.3.9.3.5.2. Con:
          Philosophical arguments can establish either that a thing is plausible, or that it is true (depending on the argument). There is no way to dismiss all arguments in a blanket way—each one must be answered individually.

      1.3.9.4. Con:
      All human knowledge is grounded, at some level, on philosophical arguments. To dismiss philosophical argumentation is to reject the search for knowledge and embrace fideism [852].

      1.3.9.5. Con:
      The parent claim is itself an example of a philosophical argument. It cannot be used to dismiss philosophical argumentation without self contradiction.

      1.3.9.6. Con:
      By this logic, we can dismiss any argument for any competing view of reality (such as materialist atheism).

    1.3.10. Pro:
    Ontological arguments [853] support the existence of God.

      1.3.10.1. Pro:
      St. Anselm [854] made an ontological argument for the existence of God.

        1.3.10.1.1. Con:
        The definition [855] of God is not a being which nothing greater can be imagined.

          1.3.10.1.1.1. Con:
          The greatest imaginable being would likely have all the properties included in the classical definition of God, so if the argument shows that the greatest imaginable being exists then it follows that it would be God.

            1.3.10.1.1.1.1. Con:
            That isn't the argument used in the proof, if the argument is changed, the proof is changed.

          1.3.10.1.1.2. Pro:
          God is defined as the ultimate being, this is not necessarily the same as the ultimate imaginable being

        1.3.10.1.2. Con:
        It is not possible to imagine the greatest thing, because we can always imagine something greater than that, in the same way that it is not possible to imagine the highest number, because we can always imagine a higher one.

          1.3.10.1.2.1. Con:
          The claim falsely equates "maximal greatness", a qualitative measure, with "maximal magnitude", a quantitative measure. 
          
          It is true that a maximal magnitude cannot exist, so we use the term "infinity" to represent this imaginary concept. However, maximal qualities can exist. There does exist a maximally great "blue"... a blue that is unadulterated by any other color.

        1.3.10.1.3. Con:
        If God does not exist, and so is nothing, then we can easily imagine a being greater than God.

          1.3.10.1.3.1. Pro:
          This proof would only support the existence of something that nobody could imagine something greater then, that thing need not be God in the traditional sense.

          1.3.10.1.3.2. Con:
          Anselm's exact point is that any being that you can imagine as "greater than God" is, in fact, God.

          1.3.10.1.3.3. Con:
          To follow Anselm's argument, God as a "being than which no greater can be conceived" undermines any ability for God not to exist. The primal characteristic of a being that is greater than which any other can be conceived is that it *is*. It's being is essential to its definition. Therefore, this being must exist.

        1.3.10.1.4. Con:
        The syllogism's third premise--to exist is greater than to not exist--has issue.

          1.3.10.1.4.1. Pro:
          St. Anselm's proof (3rd premise) incorrectly treats existence as a property that can be predicated as part of a thing's definition; existence is better treated as a quantifier, as in first order logic.

            1.3.10.1.4.1.1. Pro:
            One can imagine a being with all God's other properties, this does not make it exist.

              1.3.10.1.4.1.1.1. Con:
              The primal characteristic of an inconceivable being (that is, the being that results by thoughtfully pursuing the greatest conceivable being) is that it exists: that is the definition of a 'being'. Therefore, to Anselm's argument, imagining this being implies that it can, and philosophically does, exist.

          1.3.10.1.4.2. Pro:
          "Greatness" is left ambiguous so as to equivocate [856] its use to correlate the attribute of existence to the definition of God implicitly. Regardless of how greatness is defined, a thing is not intuitively better for existing--disease would be better as only an idea; fantasies no longer exist at all upon being realized, as by definition it loses its critical defining quality--and so the premise that "existing is greater than not existing" remains unsubstantiated.

            1.3.10.1.4.2.1. Con:
            Intuitively, something that is great already as a concept would become even greater by existing.

        1.3.10.1.5. Con:
        Existence is not a property, let alone a better-to-have property. Things that exist are not better than things that don't exist.

        1.3.10.1.6. Con:
        Aquinas rejected [857] Anselm’s ontological argument. He held that God’s existence is “self-evident in itself” but not “self-evident to us”.

        1.3.10.1.7. Pro:
        Anselm's argument defeats the proposition that "just because it can be imagined does not mean it exists", due to the subject of 'being'. The greatest conceivable being not existing faces a blunt contradiction of its primary definition of 'being' vs a state of nonexistence.

        1.3.10.1.8. Con:
        The argument assumes classical Greek notions of causation; which are demonstrably false.  It has never been the case that a single cause has led to a single effect, and it is always the fact that multiple causes lead to multiple effects.

        1.3.10.1.9. Con:
        The idea of 'A being greater than B' is not given a proper definition within the argument. Therefore it's unclear whether definition 1. is logically consistent or not.

      1.3.10.2. Pro:
      The logician Kurt Gödel formulated a modal ontological argument [858] for God's existence.

        1.3.10.2.1. Con:
        Axiom 5 (Necessary existence is positive) is false, as modalities cannot have value, since they are purely descriptive. That is, it violates the fact/value distinction.

      1.3.10.3. Con:
      Ontological arguments go one step further than asserting the existence of something, and assert a relationship between that thing and something else. They are not an argument for any being's existence, rather an additional, equally unsupported claim about what that being might do in their spare time.

        1.3.10.3.1. Con:
        None of the ontological arguments rely on or conclude with any action taken by God, or any relationship God has with a specific thing.

          1.3.10.3.1.1. Con:
          Any ontological argument offered in support of this claim, and this god [859], are being used in support of a number of assertions, not just about the existence of something, but its nature and its habits. This is a major distinction between deism [860] and classical theism.

            1.3.10.3.1.1.1. Con:
            It is more parsimonious to assume that the God argued for in the ontological arguments is the same God concluded by the cosmological and teleological arguments. Therefore, we can reasonably conclude that the God of the ontological arguments did create the universe.

        1.3.10.3.2. Pro:
        It is reasonable that in a finite material universe there are things that have the greatest properties among others. However it is impossible to conclude that "one [861]" sentient entity is the owner of all this greatest properties.

      1.3.10.4. Pro:
      Alvin Plantiga has formulated an ontological argument [862].

        1.3.10.4.1. Con:
        Plantiga's argument takes as a premise that if atheism were to be true, it would be true contingently, rather than necessarily. This is not certain and without this premise the argument simply shows the triviality that if something has necessary existence as part of its definition it either necessarily exists or necessarily doesn't.

          1.3.10.4.1.1. Con:
          A priori does not entail necessary. The parent assumes a priori arguments establish necessary conclusions in virtue of being a priori. This conflates a metaphysical notion with an epistemological notion

        1.3.10.4.2. Con:
        Necessity cannot be a great-making property, as it isn't a property, strictly speaking.

          1.3.10.4.2.1. Pro:
          Given all the properties of some thing X, one can determine whether it is necessary, possible, impossible, or contingent by examining the two propositions "there is a possible world in which X exists" and "there is a possible world in which X does not exist". Based on the truth or falsity of the two propositions, the modal status of X follows.

            1.3.10.4.2.1.1. Pro:
            If true-true, it is possible but contingent. If false-true, it is impossible. If true-false, it is necessary. (False-false cannot occur)

        1.3.10.4.3. Con:
        Hypothetical worlds in which the monotheistic God doesn't exist are trivially possible. Therefore the monotheistic God doesn't have necessary existence.

        1.3.10.4.4. Pro:
        A condensed version of Plantiga's argument:
        (1 - DEFINITION) God is a being that either (a) exists in every possible world or (b) doesn't exist in any possible world
        (2 - ASSUMPTION) Let's assume (b) is false.
        (3 - CONCLUSION) Therefore (a) is true. This implies God exists.

          1.3.10.4.4.1. Con:
          Beings cannot be defined into existence. It is possible that a being defined by (1) does not exist.

          1.3.10.4.4.2. Con:
          It is unclear how a monotheistic God would be compatible with definition (1).

            1.3.10.4.4.2.1. Pro:
            -> See 1.3.10.4.3.

          1.3.10.4.4.3. Con:
          Assumption (2) is baseless. We could just as well assume that (a) is false, and conclude that God doesn't exist.

        1.3.10.4.5. Con:
        It is not known whether or not it is possible for a god to exist.

          1.3.10.4.5.1. Con:
          In the logical sense [863], anything which cannot be proved to be logically contradictory is "possible." It is known that God is not logically contradictory.

            1.3.10.4.5.1.1. Con:
            All claims require evidence. Saying "God is possible" is a claim. Since it has not been demonstrated that God is possible, the claim "God is possible" should not be accepted.

              1.3.10.4.5.1.1.1. Con:
              The claim "x is logically possible" is equivalent to the claim "x contains no logical contradictions." Evidence cannot be given for a lack of logical contradictions, except by disproving any proposed contradictions.

              1.3.10.4.5.1.1.2. Pro:
              The possibility of being true does not make a claim rational to believe. [864]

            1.3.10.4.5.1.2. Con:
            In terms of Platinga's argument it isn't sufficient to establish that God is logically possible. There are more constraints on the universe than logical or internal consistency, even if that internal consistency is that God is contradictory but still possible.

              1.3.10.4.5.1.2.1. Pro:
              Although there is nothing logically impossible about an atom with 4000 protons, it is physically impossible.

            1.3.10.4.5.1.3. Pro:
            The first section of Robert Maydole's ontological argument [865], from the beginning to the 23rd step, proves rigorously that supremity is not self-contradictory, so it must be possible. This is all that's necessary for the rest of the argument to work.

              1.3.10.4.5.1.3.1. Con:
              The third assumption made in Robert Maydole’s Modal Ontological argument begs the question by failing to consider an assumption that would resolve the contradiction, and thus simply assume the conclusion.

                1.3.10.4.5.1.3.1.1. Pro:
                In the PBC part of the argument, the contradiction arose between P([aS]) and P([a~S]). Since the original assumption was □¬∃x(Sx), we must consider that it is also ◇¬P([aS]). If the contradiction could be resolved with this as a replaced premise (in place of premise 3), then the argument will fail. When you don't consider this at all, you assume that it is possible that a supreme being exists. I.e., you assume the conclusion and beg the question.

      1.3.10.5. Pro:
      Descartes [866] made an ontological argument for the existence of God.

        1.3.10.5.1. Con:
        Descartes was wrong, the fact that we can conceive of a perfect being does not make it real. Also his arguemnt is tautological, it asumes gods has certain charateristics and having such charcteristics proves he exists.

        1.3.10.5.2. Con:
        The structure of the argument can be used to prove that any being exists. I can use the same argument to 'prove' that a universe creating meatball exists.

        1.3.10.5.3. Con:
        Version A of the argument makes the mistake of assuming that a person decides truth.

        1.3.10.5.4. Con:
        Version B of the argument has an fallacious conclusion. It should read is "Therefore, I have an idea that a supremely perfect being exists."

        1.3.10.5.5. Con:
        Existence is not a predicate. It speaks to the quantity of something rather than its qualities. That is, necessary existence is not an essential quality of anything.

          1.3.10.5.5.1. Con:
          This is not Descartes argument. He believed that the idea of the infinite could not be conceptualizable to the finite human mind. Therefore it had to have a source outside it. That source is God.

        1.3.10.5.6. Con:
        The ability to describe a thing, such as "a supremely perfect being," is not the same as being actually able to imagine or comprehend it. For example, I can describe "A perfect sphere with exactly sixty-three corners and eight faces," but I can't imagine or comprehend it. In the latter case, the thing I described is definitionally impossible. That's not necessarily true of the former, but it is the same kind of statement, and being able to make the statement isn't proof it describes a true state

        1.3.10.5.7. Con:
        Properties can be contradictory, meaning that you cannot be maximal in both properties. As such, this argument is invalid.

          1.3.10.5.7.1. Pro:
          "Maximally Just" is contrary to "Maximally Merciful".

      1.3.10.6. Con:
      Ontological arguments require that 'existing' is a quality that must manifest to be 'maximal'. That is to say that it refuses a concept being sufficient; it confuses the conceptual and the actual.

      1.3.10.7. Con:
      A quote from the same article [867] claims that ontological arguments are not persuasive.

      1.3.10.8. Con:
      Robust refutations [868] of ontological arguments for the existence of God have reduced ontological proof for God to little more than the subject of parody.

        1.3.10.8.1. Pro:
        Kant provided a refutation [869] of ontological arguments.

          1.3.10.8.1.1. Con:
          Kant's objection doesn't apply to Plantinga's modal ontological argument  since that version of the argument doesn’t assume that existence is a property or perfection. See Questions on existence and certainty [870] and Kant’s Critique of the Traditional Arguments for the Existence of God [871]

            1.3.10.8.1.1.1. Con:
            A condensed version of Plantinga's argument [872]
            It is implicitly assumed that the being defined by (1) is real.

          1.3.10.8.1.2. Pro:
          Ontological arguments are tautological: if God exists, then God exists.

          1.3.10.8.1.3. Con:
          Kant believed that we needed an intuition from the object to give us knowledge of existence, which the concept alone could never give. His claim that existence is not a property is based on his model of perception and experience, which is problematic in a number of ways and not widely accepted by philosophers in the present day.

      1.3.10.9. Con:
      Ontological arguments for the existence of God misunderstand the emptiness of the universe and ascribe that emptiness the name God. This is basically the Primitive Buddhist position.

      1.3.10.10. Pro:
      Robert Maydole formulated a modal ontological argument [873] for God's existence

        1.3.10.10.1. Con:
        There are counter-examples to the second premise made (∀Y(P(Y) → (Z)(□∀x(Yx → Zx) → P(Z))).
        
        "Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely." It would seem that a perfection (i.e. power) implies an imperfection (i.e. corruption). [1 [874]]

          1.3.10.10.1.1. Con:
          Absolute power is the only amount of power that does not corrupt at all, because one in absolute power has nothing to gain from abusing his power, only something to lose.
          
          Example: If God exists, he would be considered to have absolute power, and also be considered to be the only perfectly un-corrupted entity in existence. However, the idea even works in relation to absolute monarchs, whose corruption was in general inversely proportional to the solidity of their reign.

            1.3.10.10.1.1.1. Con:
            Power corrupts not only in that it may be lost, or that one develops a thirst for it, although those are also factors, but in that it allows one to act unchecked. Consider for example how bored players in open world games often decide to play pranks, or outright murder the NPCs just because they can, an action that secures them no power.

          1.3.10.10.1.2. Con:
          The quote, "absolute power corrupts absolutely," is only an aphorism and has not been shown to be logically rigorous.

        1.3.10.10.2. Con:
        -> See 1.3.10.4.5.1.3.1.

        1.3.10.10.3. Con:
        The Barcan formula (a crucial element of the argument) should not be accepted.

        1.3.10.10.4. Pro:
        The S5 axiom of modal logic states that necessary statements must be either true or impossible. For instance, if it can be shown that it's possible that 2x2=4 (such as by bringing 2 sets of 2 pebbles together and counting them), 2x2=4 must be necessary in all possible worlds, and thus true. God's existence is a necessary statement, so if it is possible, it must be true.

          1.3.10.10.4.1. Pro:
          The definition of supremity used in the argument, that it is impossible for anything to be greater than a supreme being, is a necessary statement (since it contains the term "impossible"). If it is can be shown to be possible that it is impossible for anything to be greater than x, then it is impossible for anything to be greater than x, so a supreme being exists. Any supreme being would be considered God.

  1.4. Con:
  The classical [875] definition of God is contradictory or incoherent; thus, a classical God cannot, in principle, exist.

    1.4.1. Con:
    The various paradoxical assertions with the classical attributes of God can't be relied upon to negate the claim of God's existence, since the prime feature of God is that its existence does not rely upon logic.

      1.4.1.1. Pro:
      One cannot beat out an argument which argues that the object it supports to exist transcends beyond all human reasoning.

      1.4.1.2. Con:
      A God that is incoherent but exists anyway in defiance of logic is much less plausible than a God which makes sense, so if we rule out the latter that's still a win for team atheist even if God can't be deductively refuted.

      1.4.1.3. Con:
      Even an omnipotent being could not defy fundamental logic.

        1.4.1.3.1. Pro:
        The three laws of thought [876] must apply even to a god. A god must have the identity of a god, a god is either a god or not a god and a god must exist or not exist.

    1.4.2. Con:
    Inconsistencies and contradictions in how God is defined or described are the products of human limitations; once these are identified and rectified, an internally consistent depiction of God would emerge.

      1.4.2.1. Pro:
      If God exists, then they are incomprehensible to the human mind, so claims to the non-existence of God based on a lack of comprehension or coherence are invalid.

      1.4.2.2. Con:
      This is only valid if there exists a referent independent of the definition or description of God - that is, if God exists, which would be assuming the conclusion.

      1.4.2.3. Con:
      Such inconsistencies in how God is defined are inherent to the apparent evidence for such as God.

      1.4.2.4. Con:
      In classical monotheist definitions of God, God communicated/s with humans and is omnipotent and thus would have preempted such large inconsistencies the religions the large majority if not nearly all theist believers follow. Even if not, such rectifications have not occurred as of 2023 and would require very large changes, including to some of the religions' defining characteristics.

      1.4.2.5. Con:
      If such limitations exist, they are evidence that God is not Omnipotent (as he is unable to create humans without these cognitive limitations), Omniscient (as he it unable to foresee said limitations would cause issues) or Omnibenevolent (as he knowing and creating us with said limitations in mind, has intentionally obfuscated fundamental facts of his existence and creation)

      1.4.2.6. Pro:
      The logical inconsistencies of classical theism could simply be the result of faulty reasoning, in such a case God could still exist.

        1.4.2.6.1. Pro:
        The conclusion "God cannot in principle exist" does not follow from the premise "The 'classical' definition of God is contradictory or incoherent".

          1.4.2.6.1.1. Pro:
          There may be other definitions which are not contradictory or incoherent.

          1.4.2.6.1.2. Con:
          If the definition of 'God' used for the purposes of this debate is contradictory or incoherent, then for the purposes of this debate God does not exist.

        1.4.2.6.2. Pro:
        Not having a consistent definition of an object or phenomenon doesn't mean that it doesn't exist; reality exists independently of out concepts and definitions. Therefore, a better definition may be possible.

          1.4.2.6.2.1. Con:
          Truth claims that cannot be falsified by evidence, or truth claims that are self-contradictory are false. Thus, an internally inconsistent definition of something does mean that thing does not exist.

            1.4.2.6.2.1.1. Con:
            I define God as a force that cannot be defined. That being is  conceivable, in spite of not possessing the attribute that you want to imply upon Him. Also, quantum physics discovered that an electron is both a wave and a particle, which are still two opposite concepts, so a workaround had to be introduced.

          1.4.2.6.2.2. Con:
          Not having a consistent definition of an object or phenomenon prevents claims about its existence from having any impact or meaning.

            1.4.2.6.2.2.1. Con:
            First, there is no consistent definition of a spin in quantum physics, but that does not mean that it does not exist. Next, does it mean that if there is a consistent definition, then a defined object must exist. Then I will define a four-legged pink unicorn, etc...

            1.4.2.6.2.2.2. Con:
            A word has it's meaning before we give it a definition; so neither the absence of a coherent definition nor the difficulty in finding such a definition, strictly entails a term to be meaningless.

          1.4.2.6.2.3. Con:
          Each holy text of the 3 major monotheistic religions gives its own definition of God. If that definition appears to be incoherent or self-contradictory, the problem with suggesting "a better definition may be possible," is that each religion inherently asserts "no better definition than ours is possible."

        1.4.2.6.3. Pro:
        A transcendent God would naturally be difficult to describe with language, so an inconsistent definition is not a failure but a reasonable attempt to describe a transcendent concept.

          1.4.2.6.3.1. Con:
          A truly transcendent thing has no way of making contact with the material world. Any method by which contact is made cannot transcend material interaction.

            1.4.2.6.3.1.1. Pro:
            Therefore it is not only difficult to describe, it is impossible, since language itself is a material interaction.

          1.4.2.6.3.2. Con:
          This logic necessarily concedes that he cannot exist as hitherto defined under classical theism. While allowing some version of "God" to exist, it must necessarily be different from that described by Classical Theism.

          1.4.2.6.3.3. Con:
          An inconsistent definition does not allow for a rational discussion.

          1.4.2.6.3.4. Pro:
          God's infinite existence can be discussed - even proven - without defining that existence with the kind of precision reserved for humanly-knowable, finite objects. Indeed, any being that can be precisely defined by finite human language is not the truly existing infinite God. And this is no theological or philosophical cop-out. Science runs into the same kinds of problems even when it is dealing with finite objects.

        1.4.2.6.4. Con:
        If we cannot reasonably establish a definition of all powerful, all knowing, and all good, we cannot establish that God in the classical sense exists.

          1.4.2.6.4.1. Pro:
          If he does not exist in the classical sense, God could be an antagonist to be avoided or fought against.

          1.4.2.6.4.2. Con:
          The existence of a concept is not dependent on our ability to define it. At best, this would imply that we cannot know whether God exists, which is not the same as implying that God does not exist.

        1.4.2.6.5. Con:
        Suggesting something could exist does not support that it does.

          1.4.2.6.5.1. Pro:
          One could also suggest that fairies and unicorns could exist. Evidence proving they exist is vital for belief.

          1.4.2.6.5.2. Con:
          Suggesting that something could exist weakens the arguments claiming it can not exist.

        1.4.2.6.6. Con:
        An argument for faulty reasoning within Classical Theism actually begins to discredit the resulting theistic claim that a God exists through degrading the reasoning capabilities of those responsible for Classical Theism.

          1.4.2.6.6.1. Con:
          "Faulty reasoning" is proposed as an "alternate pathway" defeater and is not intended to be taken as fact supported by evidence, but only to show that the claim it counters is not necessarily true.

          1.4.2.6.6.2. Con:
          Per wikipedia definition [877], most monotheists agree on three qualities of God: all-knowing, all-capable and completely good. Qualities attributed to god in Classical theism are a superset of these, and considering this superset faulty does by no means discredit (mono)theism as a whole.

        1.4.2.6.7. Pro:
        There is no clear classical definition of God, because the attributes [878] of God are not well defined.

          1.4.2.6.7.1. Con:
          The attributes of God were clearly defined in the parameters of this discussion. No other attributes are relevant to this discussion.

          1.4.2.6.7.2. Con:
          All of the attributes of God have a proper definition.

            1.4.2.6.7.2.1. Con:
            Omnibenevolence cannot be properly defined because goodness cannot be objectively defined.

            1.4.2.6.7.2.2. Pro:
            Omnipotence means that God can actualize any possible world.

            1.4.2.6.7.2.3. Pro:
            Omniscience means that God possesses knowledge of all possible and actual states.

        1.4.2.6.8. Con:
        It means that the word God has no definition, and is therefore meaningless.

      1.4.2.7. Pro:
      Inherent contradictions may merely be apparent contradictions. Therefore, it should be elaborated further, rather than abandoned entirely.

      1.4.2.8. Pro:
      Apparent contradictions in classical theism may appear from translation difficulties.

        1.4.2.8.1. Con:
        If the definition of God used for the purpose of this debate is contradictory due to translation issues, that would still mean that, per the definition of God used in this debate, the definition of God is contradictory and so He does not exist.

        1.4.2.8.2. Pro:
        Possible contradictions in classical theism may appear from transcription difficulties and errors introduced over centuries of existence.

          1.4.2.8.2.1. Pro:
          The source ideas for classical theism - the Bible, the works of Plato, Aristotle, etc - had already existed in documented form for centuries before the classical period. The oldest Bible, for example, is from 330-360 AD [879]. The multiple rounds of transcription and retranscription that preserved those source documents over the thousands of years to today are likely to have introduced errors/ caused loss of subtlety in the original conceptions.

            1.4.2.8.2.1.1. Con:
            The oldest document of the Bible is the Septuagint with fragments dating back to 300BCE. (Of course consisting only of the Old Testament as the events of the New Testament have not yet happened).

              1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1. Con:
              The Septuagint is itself the translation into Greek of a number of earlier texts in Hebrew [880]. While there are fragments of (Hebrew) Biblical text dating back to 300 BC (and before [881]), the oldest complete Bible (compared to the book in its current form) would probably be one containing both Old and New Testament - hence the date of 300 AD. In either case, an older Bible makes an even stronger case for transmission/ transcription errors.

            1.4.2.8.2.1.2. Con:
            The original domcuments of the Bible were transcribed in several different locations, by several different monasteries, each with detailed systems in place to ensure as accurate a transcription as possible. An error made in one transcription did not infect the others due to their isolation. Therefore, we can cross examine these documents to identify and eliminate errors.thebibleproject.com [882]

              1.4.2.8.2.1.2.1. Con:
              Comparing multiple independent transcripts does help with scribal error, but it does not guarantee *perfect* transmission. Another possible problem comes from the choice of certain sources as more authoritative than others. The Masoretic Text [883], for instance, is considered the source book for the Hebrew Tanakh (Bible). Though there may be good reason to choose that source as more correct than others, this also ensures that errors/ interpretations in the Text itself become part of future canon.

          1.4.2.8.2.2. Pro:
          One apparent contradiction in classical theism is that of a theistic God changing its mind. God, per Plato [884], is changeless because a) nothing can change God, and b) God would not change, because it is already perfect. Parts of the Bible, like God repenting the creation of humanity, therefore seem to contradict theism. The problem might exist because today's Bible carries an edited version of the source documents of the Old Testament. 'Repent' might not carry the subtleties of the original text.

          1.4.2.8.2.3. Con:
          An omnipotent God should be able to keep the record of itself clear enough for it to be not contradictory.

          1.4.2.8.2.4. Con:
          Meaning that belief in the "present" definition is wrong, and since the "true" definition has been lost, there's no way to prove or disprove the existence of this definition, but surely proves that the present definition doesn't exist.

        1.4.2.8.3. Pro:
        The ideas within classical theism come from a number of thinkers, including those as far back as Plato and Aristotle. These ideas were not developed in English, and even in their native languages, were reliant on the context of their times for the subtleties of meaning involved. The version of theism we’re debating, off Wiki, is already a compressed version of a complicated concept developed in multiple languages and over several centuries. It would be more extraordinary if there were no errors.

        1.4.2.8.4. Con:
        In theory, a perfect God would be capable of communicating to man in such a way that all possible translations of the original message would still be accurate. In other words, He could make the "word of God" fool-proof; a message so utterly perfect, no man could ever misconstrue or spoil it.

      1.4.2.9. Pro:
      While the terms used to define the God of classical theism may be inconsistent, it does not follow that the referent is inconsistent. It simply means the terms used to describe God should be refined.

        1.4.2.9.1. Pro:
        The Anselmian Perfect Being Theology approach to the concept of God is to understand the various attributes of God in the manner which makes for the maximal *possible* greatness. If the alleged contradictions cannot be otherwise resolved, then the attributes should be re-described to give the maximal possible greatness. Thus the paradoxes are resolved but God remains "that being than which a greater cannot be conceived".

        1.4.2.9.2. Con:
        Refining the classical definition of God would amount to denying that God, as classically defined, exists.

          1.4.2.9.2.1. Con:
          Need for refinement of a definition does not necessarily imply lack of accuracy, but could suggest lack of precision.

            1.4.2.9.2.1.1. Pro:
            Refinement in this case could mean reducing ambiguity, thereby improving coherency.

          1.4.2.9.2.2. Pro:
          The discussion has defined god, as the god of classical theism. To redefining god by different terms, is to in turn to redefines the entire discussion, as objections and evidence supporting and opposing such a being's existence, drastically change.

          1.4.2.9.2.3. Pro:
          The definition(s) is all we have in this case, and some may argue it's all we can get. Therefore it's sensible to argue about what we have.

    1.4.3. Con:
    Only Christian conceptions of God may be contradictory or incoherent. This does not generalize to other religions.

      1.4.3.1. Pro:
      The Latter-day Saint Godhead [885] is biblically more accurate than the classical definition of God because it lacks the biblical misinterpretations of the Trinity found in "classical" Christianity [886].

        1.4.3.1.1. Pro:
        The Father is the ultimate focus of worship, the Son is Lord and Redeemer, and the Holy Spirit is the messenger and revealer of the Father and the Son.

        Although the Godhead consists of three separate beings, they are perfectly united [887] in purpose, doctrine, and bringing to pass Heavenly Father’s divine plan of salvation.

        1.4.3.1.3. Pro:
        According to Latter-day Saint belief and the Bible, the Father (John 5:17,19-21,25-26 [888]) and the Son (Luke 24:39 [889]) have tangible, glorified bodies of flesh and bone, and the Holy Ghost is a personage of spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19 [890]).

        The teachings of LDS founder Joseph Smith were more trinitarian in his earlier teachings [891], and remnants of trinitarianism persist [892] in LDS teachings today.

      1.4.3.2. Pro:
      The word 'God' refers to a concept that is defined by its valid functional role [893] within a conceptual scheme.

      1.4.3.3. Pro:
      Islam maintains a definitional framework for Allah that encompasses all his attributes without contradiction.

        1.4.3.3.1. Pro:
        The same applies to the Christian God. The Bible maintains a consistent definition of him, and there isn't a single flaw or contradiction found in the Christian God's nature throughout the Bible.

          1.4.3.3.1.1. Con:
          As Richard Dawkins said in The God Delusion: "The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction: jealous and proud of it; a petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freak; a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser; a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sado-masochistic, capriciously malevolent bully. Those of us schooled in his ways can become desensitised to their horror. [894]"

        There are contradictions in the Quran. Although murder is forbidden by law [895], there are other instances in the Quran where followers are instructed to kill others [896], seemingly unrighteously.

      1.4.3.4. Con:
      As this debate is about a specific concept of God, an argument does not need to generalize any further in order to be valid.

    1.4.4. Con:
    The classical notion of God is an over-simplified explanation of complex phenomena, intended to avoid time consuming debate of difficult problems.

    1.4.5. Pro:
    The problem of evil [897] implies that God does not exist: a God who is both omnipotent and omnibenevolent would have created a world without sin and excess suffering or be able or willing to eliminate it from the world as it exists.

      1.4.5.1. Con:
      Evil is a privation of good, and does not exist in its own right. Thus, God does not co-exist with evil.

        1.4.5.1.1. Con:
        If evil [898] is a privation [899] of good, then a thing that has no flaw is perfectly good by definition. But if it is perfectly good, then it is "omni-benevolent."

          1.4.5.1.1.1. Con:
          There is no reason to assume that good is the natural state that evil is a privation from.

            1.4.5.1.1.1.1. Pro:
            Evil has not been established to be accurately described as a mere lack of good. For example, if donating a billion dollars to a specific charity were good, failing to make that donation would not mean you are evil.

          1.4.5.1.1.2. Con:
          Flawlessness does not necessitate moral goodness.

            1.4.5.1.1.2.1. Con:
            Flawlessness by definition necessitates moral goodness. For if a thing was not morally good, how could that thing be flawless? Its lack of moral goodness would be a flaw. But if it truly is flawless, then it is necessarily morally good.

              1.4.5.1.1.2.1.1. Con:
              There are no mentions of moral goodness in the definition for flawlessness [900]. Furthermore, morally neutral things can be considered flawless.

          1.4.5.1.1.3. Con:
          "Caring about the wellbeing of humans," as the God of classical theism (particularly Abrahamic religions) is described to, in no way relates to lacking privations: it is something that must be added on to the description. Otherwise, God could be like that described by Aristotle or Spinoza (which care nothing about humans, if they can be said to care at all).

          1.4.5.1.1.4. Con:
          If evil is just a privation of good, then nothing is wrong. It could only be properly called "less good". This would mean that murder, rape, etc, are not wrong, they are simply less good.

            1.4.5.1.1.4.1. Con:
            The words "evil" and "wrong" still have meaning in the context of the privation view of evil. "Wrong" would refer to some action which corrupts the good. And evil could refer to a state of affairs strongly contrary to the good. But thinking of things as "less good" is in fact a more precise characterization, as it contains the privation aspect of evil, where the simple word "evil" can be misunderstood to imply a separately existing standard or entity by which evil is measured.

              1.4.5.1.1.4.1.1. Con:
              If things can only exist on different gradations of goodness, then rape and murder must be inherently good in some way. The fact that they exist does not make them good.

                1.4.5.1.1.4.1.1.1. Pro:
                If a god punishes things that are good, then the god lacks justice and is therefore not omnibenevolent.

                1.4.5.1.1.4.1.1.2. Con:
                Rape and murder are actions which corrupt that which is already good. To the extent they fail to completely destroy the goodness in a thing, they fail to be completely evil. But in order for a rape or murder to take place, there must be a living innocent to start with. There must be some good which is corrupted (or destroyed) by the evil act.

                  1.4.5.1.1.4.1.1.2.1. Con:
                  If it were true that things were evil solely because of the of good they destroyed, murdering an innocent 4 year old would be less wrong then murdering an old rapist, but these acts are equally wrong, therefore, it can not be true that things are evil solely because of the amount of good they destroy.

                  1.4.5.1.1.4.1.1.2.2. Con:
                  This implies that if a person were not innocent or good, that they cannot be raped.

                    1.4.5.1.1.4.1.1.2.2.1. Con:
                    Anyone being raped by definition is innocent. No one deserves rape. That's what rape is: undeserved, forced sex.

                  1.4.5.1.1.4.1.1.2.3. Con:
                  If murder is evil and murder exists, then evil exists. If evil exists, then it is not a mere lack of good.

              1.4.5.1.1.4.1.2. Con:
              If evil is contrary to "the good" then it cannot be considered a privation. It must be its own idea.

                1.4.5.1.1.4.1.2.1. Con:
                Cold is considered contrary to heat, yet cold does not exist in its own right, it is merely a privation of heat. Thus, that two concepts can be contrary says nothing about one being a privation of the other.

            1.4.5.1.1.4.2. Pro:
            Nothing is purely 100% totally "wrong" in this sense, because everything that exists, no matter how corrupted it be, still exists, and existence itself is good.

              1.4.5.1.1.4.2.1. Pro:
              Many areas of science do not rely on 100% certainty. Science is iterative. You hypothesize and then experiment to disprove and refine your hypothesis.

              1.4.5.1.1.4.2.2. Con:
              If things can only exist on different gradations of goodness, then rape and murder must be inherently good in some way. The fact that they exist does not make them good.

        If evil were completely annihilating of the good then it would have to annihilate itself because it depends upon the good of existence to manifest itself as lack.

        1.4.5.1.3. Con:
        Pain is not a privation, but rather an added, present sensation. The absence of pain is not pleasure nor joy but just analgesia. All else being equal, pain is an evil.

        1.4.5.1.4. Con:
        By this logic, if God existed, there would be less privation of good. As there is too much privation of good, it follows that God doesn't exist.

        1.4.5.1.5. Con:
        If evil can be defined as privation of good, then good can also be defined as privation of evil. We must either accept that both good and evil co-exist, or that neither exists.

          1.4.5.1.5.1. Pro:
          If good is defined as the level to which one resists and overcomes evil, then evil must be present to be resisted. "Good" cannot exist without "evil" any more than "hot" can exist without "cold". These are comparative concepts in nature, and thus require opposition to necessitate their existence.

        1.4.5.1.7. Con:
        Neither are good nor evil ontological categories. Neither exist on it's own. Both are consequences of discrimination, which borrows it's ontology from the observer.

          1.4.5.1.7.1. Pro:
          If good and evil are derived from the ontology of the observer, an omnibenevolent god does not have a fundamental existence.

      1.4.5.2. Con:
      Moral realism is required for the "problem of evil" to exist, but is also incompatible with atheism. Therefore, the problem of evil is self-defeating and can be argued to actually provide evidence of God's existence.

        1.4.5.2.1. Con:
        Atheism and moral realism are compatible therefore the "problem of evil" still persists. Moral realism can be observed in nature through the intuition that some actions are intrinsically and universally wrong, without appealing to God.

        1.4.5.2.2. Con:
        The problem of evil highlights a contradiction in a theistic and moral realist worldview; one need not actually believe evil is objectively real to posit it, only that certain things would be objectively evil if there was such a thing.

        1.4.5.2.3. Con:
        The problem of evil can be phrased as follows: if God exists, moral realism is true. If moral realism is true, genuine evil exists. If genuine evil exists, then God doesn't exist. Thus, if God exists, God doesn't exist. It follows that God doesn't exist.

        1.4.5.2.4. Pro:
        The concept of evil works only if God exists to define right and wrong. Therefore, atheists do not have a moral basis for calling something evil is in a purely physical world.

          1.4.5.2.4.1. Con:
          The existence of evil does not require a moral law beyond man.

            1.4.5.2.4.1.1. Pro:
            Even devoid of some system, someone can believe things right, or wrong, which in turn would mean there are good, and evil.

            1.4.5.2.4.1.2. Con:
            A universal position held by all human beings, (such as "murder is wrong"), suggests a Universal Mind.

          1.4.5.2.4.2. Pro:
          The fact that people presuppose evil exists in the acceptance of using it to refute a particular god suggests that they presuppose an objective moral arbitration, which requires a god.

            1.4.5.2.4.2.1. Con:
            The existence of morality doesn't imply an objective or absolute morality. Subjective morality is still morality.

          1.4.5.2.4.3. Con:
          Empathy - which enables us to determine how we would feel about the experience - can be used to evaluate actions as good and bad.

            1.4.5.2.4.3.1. Pro:
            Pain is common, yet people react strongly to people, when they are in pain. This points to empathy being a hardwired moral ability to detect evil.

              1.4.5.2.4.3.1.1. Con:
              People do get desensitized to pain and evil.

              1.4.5.2.4.3.1.2. Pro:
              Understanding other people is evolutionarily advantageous.

            1.4.5.2.4.3.2. Pro:
            In addition to atheists, many religions also derive a sense of morality from the same basic impulse - empathy - which is why these religions are similar to each other.

            1.4.5.2.4.3.3. Con:
            Empathy may be useful to discover the moral state of an action, but it does not provide an ontological basis for evil. It may explain what is evil, but it seems inadequate to explain why an action is evil.

          1.4.5.2.4.4. Con:
          Evil is defined as that which goes against humanity by humanists who do not necessarily believe in a god.

            1.4.5.2.4.4.1. Pro:
            Evil can be defined objectively, as threats to human wellbeing.

            1.4.5.2.4.4.2. Con:
            Humanists do not have the moral authority to make such a distinction.

              1.4.5.2.4.4.2.1. Con:
              Those who claim to be acting morally without reason do so without authority, but Utilitarianism is based on reason, social contract is based on reason, Kant's work is based on reason, these systems, and many more draw there authority form the reason, and logic on which they were built.

              1.4.5.2.4.4.2.2. Con:
              Humanism is not defined by man himself. It is defined by a rational exploration of what hurts and helps humanity. It exists independent of any given mind.

              1.4.5.2.4.4.2.3. Pro:
              If morality is defined by man himself, then man himself is free to rewrite the rules of morality as he pleases, whether he cares for social contracts, utilitarianism, or any other social theory or not.

        1.4.5.2.5. Con:
        Moral realism is not required for "the problem of evil" to exist and even subjective morality can proclaim conditions where actions are far more often then not, immoral and evil and many of which thesists would also agree upon.

      1.4.5.3. Pro:
      The Inductive Problem of Evil [903] makes it likely that God does not exist.

      1.4.5.4. Con:
      Since God is the defined as highest good, He would not allow any evil to exist in His works, unless His omnipotence and goodness were such as to bring good even out of evil. Therefore, incidental claims of evil on behalf of God represent an incomplete analysis, and therefore do not prove God is not good.

        1.4.5.4.1. Con:
        That an analysis which finds there to be evil must be incomplete, assumes that God exists, which is fallacious in a debate about whether God exists.

      1.4.5.5. Con:
      God is not a moral agent.

        1.4.5.5.1. Con:
        If judgments of moral quality cannot be predicated of God's acts, it is difficult to conceive of how God could be a morally good being.

        1.4.5.5.2. Con:
        Isaiah 45:7 [904] in the King James Version reads, “I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the Lord do all these things.” This makes God a moral agent of both yin and yang.

          1.4.5.5.2.1. Con:
          The use of "evil" in the King James Version is archaic; most modern translations render the word as "calamity" or "destruction". So, this passage is not specifically discussing moral evil (or good).

            1.4.5.5.2.1.1. Con:
            This points to the fact that the Bible is either unclear, or that it needs to be read in ancient Hebrew, Greek, and Aramaic.

            1.4.5.5.2.1.2. Con:
            The context of the passage shows that God created both yin and yang. God therefore created both good and evil, as well as calamity and destruction.

          1.4.5.5.2.2. Con:
          Even if God were in some sense the source of good and evil, whether by creating and sustaining the agents who participate in moral law or by shaping the circumstances under which good and evil acts are perpetrated, this still does not entail that God is a moral agent.

            1.4.5.5.2.2.1. Con:
            The Bible clearly portrays God as a moral agent. Think 1 Samuel 15:3 [905] or just think about Hell.

        1.4.5.5.3. Pro:
        Accusing God of being evil because of an evil act is akin to accusing a bear of committing murder when killing a fish.

          1.4.5.5.3.1. Con:
          Bears lack the free will to decide what action to take as well as comprehension of the meaning and consequenses of their actions. If God were like bears, that would mean he lacks free will or the ability to understand his actions, which means he is not omnipotent or not omniscient.

      1.4.5.6. Con:
      God, in his wisdom, may have morally sufficient reasons for permitting evil.

        1.4.5.6.1. Pro:
        Even if we in our limited understanding cannot comprehend God's reasons, is impossible to deductively demonstrate the impossibility of God having any morally sufficient reasons for permitting evil.

          1.4.5.6.1.1. Pro:
          Even if one critically evaluates every theodicy (divine justification) proposed by philosophers, it is always logically possible for other theodicies to exist beyond the catalogue of human speculation.

          1.4.5.6.1.2. Con:
          This speaks to the unfalsifiability of the claim. If unfalsifiability can defeat an argument, then it is a defeator for the claim that God exists.

        1.4.5.6.2. Con:
        If God had a morally sufficient reason for permitting evil, then he permits evil, which is not pure good. It is good and evil with reason; therefore, God is not all good.

        1.4.5.6.3. Con:
        To put it simply, that's a big maybe. Whatever those reasons, they would be entirely irrelevant to the well-being of sentient life and so fly in the face of anything of actual moral value.

      1.4.5.7. Con:
      It is unclear whether religions regard God as the only omnipotent agent.

        1.4.5.7.1. Con:
        No sources substantiate that; some or many theists believe Satan would also be omnipotent, and some [906] clearly find that [907] the devil is not omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent, or eternal.

      1.4.5.8. Pro:
      The same applies to excessive and/or entirely unjustified suffering in both humans and non-human animals. Proposed explanations would imply God would not be omnipotent or not omnibenevolent or neither.

      1.4.5.9. Pro:
      Birth defects with horrible implication on babies like harlequin's disease [908] where they suffer so much just after being born that the doctor himself has to put it to death raises the question of what is the point of God to send a life on earth just to make it suffer for 4 to 5 hours and come back up to him.

      1.4.5.10. Pro:
      There is no way an omnipotent all-loving god could co-exist with evil. The two are mutually exclusive by definition. Evil does not merely "imply" that God does not exist, it disproves his existence entirely.

        1.4.5.10.1. Con:
        God may have created the universe but the Bible indicates that people later might have deviated from God's vision through free will.

          1.4.5.10.1.1. Pro:
          Initially, according to the Bible, there was no sin or death in God's creation. When Satan fell [909] (fuller discussion) [910] he tempted Eve to trespass the law of God by eating the fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Eve offered this fruit to her husband Adam and he knowingly committed sin. Therefore, sin entered the world and death by sin. God gave man a free will and man brought evil into the world by improperly using that free will.

          1.4.5.10.1.2. Con:
          Nothing in the Bible suggests that the physical nature of humans have been modified from the original design by God. Hence the biological nature of homosexuality, which is backed by a huge scientific consensus, is the will of God.Diversity in human sexuality (2015 meta-study by the Academy of Science of South Africa) [911]

          1.4.5.10.1.3. Con:
          In Matthew 9:11-12 Jesus implies within his cultural context [912] that some people are born homosexual.

            1.4.5.10.1.3.1. Con:
            This could be due to evil coming into world after it's creation.

        1.4.5.10.2. Pro:
        A solution would be the existence of an all-knowing, all-powerful but evil god; this strongly violates classical theism's assumptions [913].

          1.4.5.10.2.1. Con:
          An evil god does not solve the problem of evil, because it is just as strongly disproved by the existence of good in the world as a good god is disproved by the existence of evil.

          1.4.5.10.2.2. Con:
          That is incorrect. It could also be that God has other purposes that we do not understand that are served by giving men free will, even if they use it horribly.

            1.4.5.10.2.2.1. Con:
            Any such purpose would imply that God either can't do away with evil or does not want to, which circles back to the initial claim in this respect [914].

          1.4.5.10.2.3. Con:
          The "evil god" hypothesis assumes the existence of a higher standard of morality, and thereby recognizes that this so-called "god" is a pretender to the throne of the God whose nature and character is the very source of morality.

          1.4.5.10.2.4. Con:
          The "evil god" hypothesis imports our own definition of good and evil into that reality and does not evaluate the reality forged by that god on its own terms.

            1.4.5.10.2.4.1. Pro:
            By recognizing a standard of good and evil that supervenes even on other possible worlds, this claim acknowledges that good and evil are necessary objects. This provides evidence that God necessarily exists in our world and all possible worlds, and the standard of goodness set by his character exists in all possible worlds.

        1.4.5.10.3. Pro:
        Many theists base their belief in God on good in the world, while the stories in their religious texts tend to depict the Gods of classical theism as selfish evil tyrants with bad attitudes, short tempers, lust for death and destruction, and a general disregard for the value of anything other then themselves, even when those same texts defined such Gods as being good no matter what they do.

          1.4.5.10.3.1. Con:
          The Christian God is depicted as slow to anger and rich in mercy.  Jonah actually complains to God that he is not nearly vengeful enough. (Jonah 4)

          1.4.5.10.3.2. Con:
          God's justice and wrath against immorality is not evidence that God is an evil, selfish, tyrant.

          1.4.5.10.3.3. Pro:
          The god of Abraham is described as genocidal. Genocide is immoral. Therefore, moral arguments for the god of Abraham are invalid if they are based on omnibenevolence.

            1.4.5.10.3.3.1. Con:
            The "genocides" depicted in the Old Testament were God's punishment against evil people for their immorality. As such Genocide is not intrinsically immoral.

              1.4.5.10.3.3.1.1. Con:
              Hitler's attempted genocide was punishment for his perceived evil nature of Jewish people, yet it was still immoral.

            1.4.5.10.3.3.2. Pro:
            According to Genesis 6-9 [915], God was the first entity to commit genocide, thereby inventing the practice.

            1.4.5.10.3.3.3. Pro:
            According to Exodus 11-12 [916], God committed genocide against the first born of Egyptian households.

            1.4.5.10.3.3.4. Pro:
            According to Judges 20 [917], God commits genocide against the Benjaminites.

              1.4.5.10.3.3.4.1. Con:
              This is either a deliberate and gross misrepresentation or completely ignorant account of God’s actions as they relate to Israel’s first civil war.

            1.4.5.10.3.3.5. Con:
            Many of the genocides [918] attributed to God are actually commanded by humans (such as Moses), and carried out by humans, not God.

              1.4.5.10.3.3.5.1. Con:
              In many cases where God does not explicitly order the genocide, he encourages it or does nothing to stop it. This still makes God complicit in these genocides.

              1.4.5.10.3.3.5.2. Con:
              In the particular case of Amalekites (1 Samuel 15) God is unambiguously responsible for the genocide.

              1.4.5.10.3.3.5.3. Con:
              In their historical contexts, it is likely that the biblical accounts did in fact intent to attribute these commands to God.

        1.4.5.10.4. Con:
        If God does not exist, there is no basis upon which to affirm objective moral values and duties. Therefore, talking about the morality of God is meaningless.

        1.4.5.10.5. Con:
        There is a way and it is called a free will. Free will is not a valid argument against the classical problem of theodicy, since nobody will wish an evil to himself. But in dharmic religions there is a concept of karma, which means that reactions to our actions are delayed. The purpose is to educate us about what is good and evil, by a personal experience of what is favorable and what is not. Karma explains why is there evil alongside with loving God.

          1.4.5.10.5.1. Con:
          There are many forms of suffering that cannot be attributed to karma. Terrible things happen to even the most innocent and good people.

          1.4.5.10.5.2. Con:
          If the purpose of suffering is to educate us then an omnipotent God could have just created us with that education in the first place, thereby avoiding the need for anyone to suffer.

          1.4.5.10.5.3. Con:
          Dharmic religions also have the concept of "Brahman"... the ultimate reality in the universe. According to Chandogya Upanishad 3.14.1, "This whole universe is Brahman. In tranquility, let one worship It, as Tajjalan (that from which he came forth, as that into which he will be dissolved, as that in which he breathes)."
          
          If all is Brahman, evil and good are essentially identical. Karma cannot explain how to differentiate between two identical things.

          1.4.5.10.5.4. Con:
          According to the doctrine of Karma, all evil that happens to us is brought upon us by our own past evils.
          
          This cannot describe how the first evil was done to us, before we had performed an evil deed. It requires an infinite regress of past lives, or a non-karmic evil to start the chain of karma, which denies the premise that all evil is the result of past evil.

          1.4.5.10.5.5. Con:
          Free will does not justify the ability to execute the will to cause harm, just like free will does not grant the ability to fly (unaided) to those who want to fly.

        1.4.5.10.6. Con:
        There is no reason they are mutually exclusive.

          1.4.5.10.6.1. Pro:
          If a set of claims is consistent, then any subset of that set is also consistent. The following set of claims is consistent: (1) God exists, (2) God has a good reason for allowing evil, (3) Evil exists. Therefore the set comprising (1) and (3) is consistent and there is no incompatibility here.

            1.4.5.10.6.1.1. Pro:
            This "consistency strategy" would fail only if (2) were logically impossible. However, that doesn't seem to be the case. For example, even if the free will defence doesn't provide God's *actual* reasons for allowing evil, it does provide a *possible* reason, and that is all the consistency strategy requires to show there is no logical contradiction between (1) and (3).

          1.4.5.10.6.2. Con:
          A good and able God would both want and be able to stop evil.

            1.4.5.10.6.2.1. Con:
            We don't always do everything that we want to do and are able to do. Sometimes doing those things is incompatible with other things we want.

        1.4.5.10.7. Con:
        The concept of evil could not exist without a moral standard. The existence of God creates a moral standard to define good and evil.

          1.4.5.10.7.1. Con:
          The mere existence of God doesn't create a moral standard of good and evil. It would be God's words and actions that would define good and evil.

            1.4.5.10.7.1.1. Con:
            It's possible that, through His nature, God embodies, rather than commands, what is right. In this view, God and morality are the same thing.

              1.4.5.10.7.1.1.1. Con:
              The Euthyphro dilemma is not avoided by equivocating "God" with "Good" (i.e. morality).

                1.4.5.10.7.1.1.1.1. Pro:
                Supposing "God" and "Good" were synonyms, it would be impossible for a person to be (or do) Good in this sense without that person necessarily also being God. In other words, there would be no function in discussing "the moral capacity of human beings" since Good is reserved by (and indistinguishable from) God.

                1.4.5.10.7.1.1.1.2. Pro:
                Supposing "God" and "Good" are synonyms and also that there remain actions which are morally right or morally wrong for a person to do, the provision of synonyms only tells us about the qualities of God, but has yet to provide any insight whatsoever into distinguishing actions which are morally right from those that are morally wrong. Note the ironic resemblance of this problem to that in the Euthyphro [919] itself (Euthyphro's third definition [920] of "piety").

              1.4.5.10.7.1.1.2. Con:
              Embodiment of a characteristic is distinct from being the cause of it. Regardless of whether or not God embodies what is right, this concept of what is right can and does exist independently of God. Thus, there is no distinct proof for the existence of God based on the existence of morality. Ultimately, then moral arguments for God still fail.

              1.4.5.10.7.1.1.3. Pro:
              The classical definition of God historically includes Divine Simplicity [921], which implies that God is without parts [922] or distinct components or attributes.

                1.4.5.10.7.1.1.3.1. Pro:
                The parts of even the most fundamental material components of the universe, such as elementary particles, are still composed of at least two metaphysical parts: potentiality and actuality.

                  1.4.5.10.7.1.1.3.1.1. Con:
                  The definition of simple that was provided says nothing about not being changeable.

                    1.4.5.10.7.1.1.3.1.1.1. Con:
                    Potentiality and actuality are metaphysical attributes and hence fall under the provided definition.

                  1.4.5.10.7.1.1.3.1.2. Pro:
                  Changeability implies composition of the metaphysical parts: act and potency. [923] Composition is contrary to the definition of simplicity.

                    1.4.5.10.7.1.1.3.1.2.1. Con:
                    If Composition is contrary to simplicity and changeability means composition, then any description of god changing in any way is proof that god is not simple. God becoming his own son, or creating new laws at any point, for instance, point to god being changeable. Therefore, many descriptions of a god are changeable and cannot be considered simple.

                      1.4.5.10.7.1.1.3.1.2.1.1. Con:
                      Whether the descriptions of a particular religion compromise the simplicity of God is another debate entirely, since the God of classical theism could exist even if this or that theistic religion presents an incoherent picture of that God.

                      1.4.5.10.7.1.1.3.1.2.1.2. Con:
                      In orthodox Christian theology, the Incarnation does not represent a change in God's Divine Essence but rather a hypostatic union of Jesus' changeable, human nature with the unchangeable divine nature.

                        1.4.5.10.7.1.1.3.1.2.1.2.1. Pro:
                        “We do not conceive the mode of conjunction to be according to addition (i.e. change)”; just as in the union of man with God, nothing is added to God by the grace of adoption, but what is divine is united to man; hence, not God but man is perfected. [924]

                      1.4.5.10.7.1.1.3.1.2.1.3. Con:
                      God's creating a new (moral) law does not entail a change in God's essence, but rather an addition to the content of revelation granted to humanity.

                  1.4.5.10.7.1.1.3.1.3. Pro:
                  The particles are actual to the extent that any given particle is really present, but they are potential to the extent that any given particle could be in a different location, or energy state, or really could be changed in any way.

                1.4.5.10.7.1.1.3.2. Con:
                God is composed of smaller parts.

                  1.4.5.10.7.1.1.3.2.1. Pro:
                  Brahman in Hinduism is split into smaller gods.

                  1.4.5.10.7.1.1.3.2.2. Pro:
                  In Catholicism, the Holy Trinity is composed of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

                1.4.5.10.7.1.1.3.3. Con:
                The theory of Divine Simplicity is an example of moving the goalposts [925].

                  1.4.5.10.7.1.1.3.3.1. Pro:
                  Divine Simplicity differentiates "good" as it pertains to God from "good" as is (or can be) defined and understood by humans. See Divine Simplicity [926]: "...God's attributes can only be spoken of by analogy."

                1.4.5.10.7.1.1.3.4. Con:
                Divine Simplicity posits that the essence of God is inexpressible [927]. In other words, any definition of God is insufficient. Thus, Divine Simplicity is a technical concession that God cannot exist as defined under Classical Theism.

                1.4.5.10.7.1.1.3.5. Con:
                Divine Simplicity is rejected by some philosophical proponents of theism. For example, Dr. William Lane Craig [928] is a renowned theologian and philosopher on religion who rejects divine simplicity [929].

                Gottlob Frege [930] distinguished between the 'sense' of an expression and its 'reference [931]'.

                  1.4.5.10.7.1.1.3.6.1. Pro:
                  While the statement "God is omnipotent" does not mean the same thing as "God is omniscient", it doesn't follow that they are not statements about the same one reality.

                  "The evening star" does not have the same sense as "the morning star", but both expressions refer to one and the same thing--namely, the planet Venus. Similarly for descriptions of God. (from p 77 of 5 Proofs of the Existence of God [932])

          Atheist also have moral standards. Morality is not founded upon religion alone.

        1.4.5.10.8. Con:
        It is impossible to know a priori whether an omnipotent and omnibenevolent God could co-exist with evil.

          1.4.5.10.8.1. Pro:
          To rule out a prior the compatibility of divine omnipotence, divine omnibenevolence, and real evil, one would need to prove that there are in principle no justifiable reasons for God to permit evil to exist. To know this would require knowing all possible outcomes of evil in the world, knowledge which no human has or can have.

            1.4.5.10.8.1.1. Pro:
            It's impossible to say with any acceptable certainty that the state of the world isn't justified from God's perspective.

              1.4.5.10.8.1.1.1. Pro:
              Any given "evil" circumstance has results that can continue to affect other circumstances long after, and far away from, the original circumstance. Chaos theory [933] shows that accurately predicting, and therefore judging the weight of, these consequences is far beyond the scope of human intelligence.

                1.4.5.10.8.1.1.1.1. Con:
                If God is omnipotent then God can do anything. If God can do anything, then good does not have to come from evil unless God decides that it must be the case. If God is omnibenevolent, God would not allow evil. Therefore, God would not require evil for good.

                  1.4.5.10.8.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
                  It may not be possible, even in principle, to have a physical reality with good and without evil.

                1.4.5.10.8.1.1.1.2. Con:
                There is no reason that an all powerful god would have to utilize chaotic systems to realize a certain outcome.

                1.4.5.10.8.1.1.1.3. Con:
                These consequences are not beyond the scope of God's intelligence. And a kind explanation from God is not beyond the scope of human intelligence.

              1.4.5.10.8.1.1.2. Pro:
              We cannot know what God is thinking.

                We can if He chooses to share.

              1.4.5.10.8.1.1.3. Con:
              Moral standards should be acceptable, for making a sensible claim. If God bothered to give us moral standards, then He should have also told us why He violates them. Suspicious silence about Himself, while being vocal about human moral issues raise reasonable doubts.

        1.4.5.10.9. Pro:
        An uncaring God is compatible with the existence of evil.

        1.4.5.10.10. Pro:
        If a God is all knowing and good, it should also know the future. If it is the case and it gives free will to people, knowing already that people will do bad, and then punishes them, this is either sadistic or perverted, so not good.

        1.4.5.10.11. Pro:
        A fictional, non-existent God is compatible with the existence of evil.

      1.4.5.11. Con:
      For God to 'do away with all sin' requires limits to be placed on self determination.

        1.4.5.11.1. Con:
        Unlimited self determination may not necessarily be a good thing.

        1.4.5.11.2. Con:
        Self-Determination is a debatable concept as is, even without the potential presence of an omniscient creator.

          1.4.5.11.2.1. Pro:
          An Omniscient creator would know the potential actions of its creation before it was made. Creating them, knowing there will certainly be evil as a consequence of said creation is in itself evil.

        1.4.5.11.3. Con:
        There is a distinction between a perfect agent and a perfect automaton. In heaven, humans may maintain their free will while simultaneously being free of evil; rather than creating humans that can't sin, God could have created humans that won't sin.

          1.4.5.11.3.1. Pro:
          If an inability to sin places limits on free will, then God has no free will. Hence, he should be able to create humans without it too. If, instead, an inability to sin does not limit free will, then God should be able to create humans with free will and without sin.

          1.4.5.11.3.2. Pro:
          An omniscient, omnipotent being must necessarily be the only morally responsible agent in existence. The freedom of other beings to exist or do anything at all is contingent upon the approval (or ignorance) of the one who can make and unmake at will.

        1.4.5.11.4. Pro:
        Free will exists within the universe, and can only be caused by another free will. Thus the thing which caused the universe had free will, and must be an intelligent being.

          1.4.5.11.4.1. Con:
          The assumption that things must come from things like them is false, as the rocks, and sticks that start a fire are not hot.

        1.4.5.11.5. Con:
        This ignores 'natural evil' [934] where natural disasters and diseases cause huge amounts of suffering.

      1.4.5.12. Pro:
      The Epicurean Paradox [935] proves that evil cannot co-exist with an omnipotent benevolent God.

        1.4.5.12.1. Pro:
        The Christian God created homosexuality [936], and yet simultaneously calls for its lethal punishment [937].

          1.4.5.12.1.1. Pro:
          There is no evidence [938] that homosexuality, which some consider a sin, represents an expression of free will.

          1.4.5.12.1.2. Con:
          Jesus never advocated for lethal punishment; in fact, he stopped lethal punishment on more than one occasion.

            1.4.5.12.1.2.1. Pro:
            When the religious priests were ready to stone a woman caught in adultery [939] to death, Jesus said to them, "Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her."

          1.4.5.12.1.3. Con:
          It is theoretically possible that homosexuality arose via evolution-linked changes to genetic structure, which could be considered a deviation from God.

            1.4.5.12.1.3.1. Con:
            This still presents a contradiction, as only God would be able to create evolution, or the means of its existence. Either God is not in charge of God's plan, or God is still on the hook for creating people in a way they condemn.

          1.4.5.12.1.4. Pro:
          Leviticus 20:13 [940] says, "If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them."

            1.4.5.12.1.4.1. Con:
            At most, scripture calls for punishment of homosexual behavior—which is the action of an individual, rather than a thing created by God.

            1.4.5.12.1.4.2. Con:
            Verses condemning homosexuality are misinterpreted [941] and do not actually call for discrimination.

        1.4.5.12.2. Con:
        Evil is anthropocentrically ill-defined and hugely subjective; things that we think are natural Evils to us (like diseases, natural disasters and death itself) serves themselves as Good to the world, abiding by the scientific laws that govern them.

          1.4.5.12.2.1. Pro:
          God should not change the science of the world specifically for us; if the whole of Creation is good (Genesis 1:31) then God doesn't owe his sustenance to us, but equally to everything in His Creation, all of which are products of His designed Science.

            1.4.5.12.2.1.1. Con:
            We can interrogate the concept of an omnibenevolent God without granting the divine command theory [942] of morality, and hence we can discard the idea that "the whole of creation is good" and recognise that e.g. the smallpox virus [943] was not good and did not deserve to exist.

          1.4.5.12.2.2. Con:
          The Epicurean argument does not assume that some things are objectively evil. A subjective concept of evil is enough to make the argument work.

        1.4.5.12.3. Con:
        God may be able and willing to stop evil, and may in fact be doing so in His own time and in His own way for reasons of His own.

          1.4.5.12.3.1. Pro:
          According to scripture, God is able and willing, but refrains from doing so, because that would mean God would have to eradicate all mankind. God allows evil to exist so we can exist and be saved.

          1.4.5.12.3.2. Con:
          The Epicurean paradox is concerned with the prevention (and not the termination) of evil.

          1.4.5.12.3.3. Con:
          If people who are dying could be saved by prompt and direct intervention by an omnipotent God, then such a God cannot be considered good.

        1.4.5.12.4. Con:
        The epicurean paradox has a hidden assumption [944] that God can create a world where people have free will that is without evil.

        1.4.5.12.5. Con:
        The alleged inconsistency depends on an unproven assumption: that a perfect God could not have any good reason to allow sin for a while.

          1.4.5.12.5.1. Pro:
          Analogically, if life were a video game, sins would be the gameplay obstacles that make the game enjoyable. The use of obstacles in the game does not make the game developer imperfect.

          1.4.5.12.5.2. Pro:
          God allowing sin for a short time is valuable because it means that people in Heaven will be able to appreciate God more, knowing what he freed them from.

      1.4.5.13. Con:
      Impassibility [945] in the classical definition of God takes care of the problem of evil.

        1.4.5.13.1. Con:
        The fact that an all-powerful being can be completely apathetic to human suffering does not make such a deity seem less immoral.

    1.4.6. Pro:
    The God of the Bible is contradictory, as God's character, wishes, directions, laws and outlook all change between the old and new testaments.

      1.4.6.1. Con:
      Between the old and new testament, it's not God that changes, but people and their perception of him.

        1.4.6.1.1. Con:
        This is not scripturally true. The nature of God varies even throughout the old testament. The story of Noah is probably the most well-known example thereof. [Genesis 8:20]

          1.4.6.1.1.1. Con:
          Genesis 8:20 doesn't describe God's nature changing. God smells a burnt offering and says that he will never send another flood. However, there is no evidence that he was planning to do otherwise before this.

      1.4.6.2. Con:
      The New Testament begins with the arrival of Jesus Christ who is the tool used to change God's systems of worship, repentance, and redemption. God's character, wishes, and outlook do not change. The purpose of His law changes, but not the laws themselves. His directions change as necessary according to the fulfillment of Christ's mission (a holy life, death, burial, resurrection, and identification after resurrection.)

    1.4.7. Pro:
    God is said to be all powerful (omnipotent), but also unable to do certain things.

      1.4.7.1. Pro:
      God cannot be both omnipotent and omnibenevolent, because suffering (e.g., natural disasters) exists. This implies that God is either unable or unwilling to stop these events.

        1.4.7.1.1. Con:
        Suffering may be inextricably tied to far greater good things, the loss of which would not be worth the abolition of suffering.

          1.4.7.1.1.1. Con:
          An all powerful God does not need suffering to achieve any other goal than suffering itself, if he does then he is not all powerful.

            1.4.7.1.1.1.1. Con:
            That God might not need to use suffering to achieve his goals is not sufficient to defeat the parent claim.

              1.4.7.1.1.1.1.1. Pro:
              It is possible that God only permits suffering as necessary to achieve the greatest amount of good.

                1.4.7.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
                There isn't any reason to believe any negative thing (suffering) is strictly necessary for a good thing, and thus an omnipotent being wouldn't need any negative thing to produce any good thing.

                1.4.7.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con:
                Thinking that God, a benevolent deity, has a plan is simply a coping mechanism, or a narrative to explain an incongruity in the light of seemingly meaningless suffering.

                  1.4.7.1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con:
                  Without God, all suffering is meaningless.

                    1.4.7.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.2. Pro:
                    In an atheistic universe, there is no ultimate meaning. Any meaning we manage to create by definition arises from beings with no purpose, and is completely illusory.

                    1.4.7.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.3. Pro:
                    In an atheistic universe, in 200 years, the fate of the one who suffers, and the one who inflicts suffering is exactly the same. Both will be dead and consigned to oblivion forever.

                    1.4.7.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.4. Con:
                    One has the ability to not believe in any god, and still find meaning, or a greater cause [946] in their suffering.

                      1.4.7.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.4.1. Con:
                      The grandparent claim does not address, nor does it depend on one's belief in God, but in the actual existence of God, regardless of one's belief in Him, or lack thereof.

              1.4.7.1.1.1.1.2. Pro:
              God may have chosen suffering in lieu of some other method of achieving the same goal that would actually be worse than the suffering that He permits.

                1.4.7.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con:
                This assumes both that suffering is unavoidable and that the suffering we observe is the least possible to achieve what goods are produced. Both of these are highly doubtful.

            1.4.7.1.1.1.2. Con:
            The conclusion reached in the claim is a non sequitur. Even if God requires suffering to achieve His goals, it does not follow that he is not omnipotent in the classic sense.

              1.4.7.1.1.1.2.1. Con:
              An omnipotent being would be able to attain their goals and eliminate suffering, unless they desired suffering. So either this being ("God") cannot eliminate suffering (i.e. is not omnipotent), or they do not want to eliminate suffering (i.e. not "loving").

              1.4.7.1.1.1.2.2. Con:
              No good thing requires suffering. Thus, either the suffering is unnecessary or God's goals are not good.

          1.4.7.1.1.2. Pro:
          There is meaning in suffering.

            1.4.7.1.1.2.1. Con:
            There are some instances of suffering that have every appearance of seeming needless, having no indirect or compensatory benefit.

            1.4.7.1.1.2.2. Pro:
            Pain and suffering are far more effective as motivators and teaching tools than many alternatives, and so are necessary for salvation.

              1.4.7.1.1.2.2.1. Pro:
              It's very likely that in a world without pain, where all creatures are content at all times, there would be absolutely no motivation to change and grow. As such, creatures need to be motivated to avoid pain and pursue happiness.

                1.4.7.1.1.2.2.1.1. Con:
                A world without pain does not at all imply a world without motivation. Humans are often motivated to learn about things that they find interesting or enjoyable, without any threats or pressure.

            1.4.7.1.1.2.3. Pro:
            Being all powerful, all knowing, with an eternal perspective, God may have determined that finite suffering (however intense) has eternal benefit. God calls us to trust him. (See Romans 8:28 [947]; Psalm 66:10-12 [948])

              1.4.7.1.1.2.3.1. Con:
              The god of the Bible is not perfectly good and therefore does not meet the definition set forth by this debate.

                1.4.7.1.1.2.3.1.1. Con:
                The God of the Bible is attributed the property of goodness (Psalm 34:8, Mark 10:18. Acts 14:17, James 1:17).

              1.4.7.1.1.2.3.2. Con:
              An all powerful God ought to be able to create good without suffering.

                1.4.7.1.1.2.3.2.1. Con:
                Omnipotence [949] is sometimes defined as "maximal power," which includes the ability to do anything possible, but does not include the ability to do anything impossible or paradoxical.

                1.4.7.1.1.2.3.2.2. Con:
                Of course God could have created a good world without suffering. However, to think that a world without suffering is the best possible world that God could have created given His purposes is an assumption. This cannot possibly be known without omniscience. The burden of proof is too high.

              1.4.7.1.1.2.3.3. Con:
              It can easily be proven by geology that there has never been a global flood [950]. This is an observable fact about the earth. Yet, the Bible says clearly that there was a global flood.

            1.4.7.1.1.2.4. Pro:
            The possibility of evil and pain are the necessary consequences to permitting true free human will under an all powerful and all knowing God.

              1.4.7.1.1.2.4.1. Con:
              There are many kinds of pain and suffering that do not facilitate free will. Debilitating genetic diseases that kill children in infancy and are of no fault of the parents or the child yet they still occur.

              1.4.7.1.1.2.4.2. Con:
              If it is so that a world without "free will" cannot be without evil, then it must follow that God created a world wherein this was the case. To assert that God could not possibly have done otherwise is to assert that God is not omnipotent [951]. 
              
              As such, this claim actually proves the problem of evil.

              1.4.7.1.1.2.4.3. Con:
              The possibility of evil cannot be justified by the greater  goodness of free will if free will is itself impossible. Free will depends on the abililty to make a meaningful choice. A choice cannot be both independant of the state of affairs and meaningful.

                1.4.7.1.1.2.4.3.1. Con:
                This argument seems to rest on an equivocation in the meaning of the word "free", shifting it from "not externally compelled" to "not externally motivated". Choice is free so long as it is not compelled, and can meaningfully take into account externalities without being compelled. There is no contradiction

              1.4.7.1.1.2.4.4. Pro:
              Many classical religions offer people a choice between a "heaven" and a "hell", implying that God grants free will to his creations. The Adam and Eve story corroborates this by resulting in the pair learning good and evil. God clearly permits evil to happen, even if He Himself is completely good.

              1.4.7.1.1.2.4.5. Con:
              Intentonally making creatures capable of evil is in itself an act of evil and means that God is not omnibenevolent.

                1.4.7.1.1.2.4.5.1. Con:
                Unfree creatures who always make the "right" decision would not be doing any moral good, any more than an asteroid that hits the Earth and wipes out life would be doing moral evil. So while giving creatures free will does produce some evil, it also allows moral goodness to exist, and thus is justified on the whole.

                1.4.7.1.1.2.4.5.2. Con:
                The argument "making creatures with a capacity for evil is evil" is not actually a counterargument to the point that a just God would do so in order to create creatures with a capacity for free will so much as it simply denies the premise that free will is a supervening good making the capacity for evil itself a good because free will is impossible without the capacity to choose evil.

                  1.4.7.1.1.2.4.5.2.1. Con:
                  There are already various things that we cannot do. There is no justification to not make evil part of the things that we cannot do.

                  1.4.7.1.1.2.4.5.2.2. Con:
                  The claim that free will is a supervening good, directly implies in this context that the capacity for evil (and therefore the existence of evil) is a supervening good, which is self-contradicting.

              1.4.7.1.1.2.4.6. Pro:
              In Genesis, suffering is explained as a failing on Man's part, not on God's.  He created man in the Garden of Eden without sin and asked only that they not partake of the knowledge of good and evil.  They did and as promised, eventually died, the knowledge of which was the first example of human suffering.

        1.4.7.1.2. Pro:
        If God is omnipotent (all-powerful) and omniscient (all-knowing), then God could have created a reality in which pain, suffering and evil were not possible. Therefore, God is responsible for the existence of all pain, suffering and evil.

        1.4.7.1.3. Pro:
        In the Bible, the Christian God is shown as omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent but he is also shown creating natural disasters [952].

        1.4.7.1.4. Pro:
        Biblical writings are contradictory, condone ideas we find repugnant today, or are otherwise problematic.

          1.4.7.1.4.1. Pro:
          Romans 10:17 [953] speaks of faith coming by hearing the word of God. I have read the word of God, and I don't have faith; therefore the scripture did not prove true, therefore it is false.

            1.4.7.1.4.1.1. Pro:
            Deuteronomy 4:2 [954] says Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you.

            1.4.7.1.4.1.2. Con:
            The parent claim is logically flawed. Paul did not claim that hearing the word of God necessarily implies faith, rather that faith implies having heard the word of God.

          1.4.7.1.4.2. Pro:
          Deuteronomy 4:2 [955] says Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you. Time and translation necessarily add unto or diminish from texts as evidenced by a myriad of interpretations. God would not have built in an impossibility.

            1.4.7.1.4.2.1. Con:
            A myriad of interpretations does not prove that time and translation materially change the meaning of the texts.

          1.4.7.1.4.3. Pro:
          Romans 1:20 [956]-21 [957] assumes the claim it is trying to prove twice.

          1.4.7.1.4.4. Pro:
          Romans 1:20 [958] misunderstands the nature of evidence.

          1.4.7.1.4.5. Pro:
          Proverbs 3:5 [959] suggests you can be saved at the low cost of your critical faculties.

            1.4.7.1.4.5.1. Con:
            Rather than giving up one's critical faculties, the proverb is pointing out that humans should trust the knowledge of God, similarly to how small children trust their parents. The Bible often makes assertions that the knowledge and wisdom of God is higher than that of humans and should be preferred. (Proverbs 1:7, 2:1-15; Isaiah 55:8-9)

        1.4.7.1.5. Con:
        That definition of God is not incompatible with the existence of suffering.

          1.4.7.1.5.1. Con:
          Providing that suffering is bad, we could conclude, that allowing for suffering God created world which is not perfect; and while he is, he should have done a perfect one.

      1.4.7.2. Con:
      -> See 1.3.7.3.4.2.3.3.1.3.2.1.1.

      1.4.7.3. Pro:
      The past, present, and future are not changeable. Therefore, God cannot be omnipotent.

      1.4.7.4. Pro:
      Omnipotence and omniscience are contradictory, as it impossible to be able to change your future if you already know what it is; making free-will, even for god, logically impossible.

      1.4.7.5. Con:
      Anything that God can't do isn't problematic as the only things that God cannot do are acts contrary to his nature.

        1.4.7.5.1. Con:
        Omnipotence is a matter of having the power to do anything, whether or not one chooses to use that power. God's desire to do an act is irrelevant when considering his ability to do an act.

        1.4.7.5.2. Con:
        If you claim that omnipotence is the ability to do anything within one's nature, any human could claim to be omnipotent. Can't lift a rock? No problem. It simply wasn't within the nature of the person to be that strong. Of course, one could argue that every being, including the classical gods, are omnipotent, but that rather defeats the purpose.

      1.4.7.6. Pro:
      Omnipotence is inherently contradictory.

        1.4.7.6.1. Pro:
        Black holes [960] are examples of objects that are impossible to lift.

          1.4.7.6.1.1. Con:
          Black holes are not impossible to lift; they have a finite mass and are being accelerated by nearby astronomical objects [961].

            1.4.7.6.1.1.1. Con:
            The effect of gravity does not constitute lifting. Gravity causes objects to fall.

        1.4.7.6.2. Pro:
        God is frequently defined as an "all-powerful" being, which implies the ability to do things which are logically impossible, such as drawing a square circle on a 2D plane.

        1.4.7.6.3. Pro:
        Either an all-powerful being cannot create a stone so heavy that the being cannot lift it, or if such a stone is created it is an object the being isn't powerful enough to lift. In either case the being's power is limited.

          1.4.7.6.3.1. Con:
          "A stone that can't be lifted by an omnipotent being" isn't a thing that God can't create because it's not a thing, only a series of words that have been put in a certain order. This only defeats God's omnipotence in the same way as His inability to create a married bachelor.

          1.4.7.6.3.2. Con:
          Examples of things that God cannot do are logically nonsensical and meaningless (e.g. make a square circle).

            1.4.7.6.3.2.1. Con:
            If a square circle is illogical and meaningless, then so is God. as his very nature (outside space & time) is also logically nonsensical and meaningless.

              1.4.7.6.3.2.1.1. Con:
              This is a non-sequitur [962]. Square circles are impossible because the two terms are mutually exclusive.  The claim that God exists outside of space and time has no inherent contradiction.

                1.4.7.6.3.2.1.1.1. Pro:
                Many things exist outside of space and time - numbers, for example, or pieces of music, stories, abstract properties.

                  1.4.7.6.3.2.1.1.1.1. Con:
                  It is false that constructs that are spaceless or timeless are "logically nonsensical". What is logically inconsistent (nonsensical) are statements that are logically contradictory. Lacking a spatial manifold or timescale doesn't amount to logical contradiction, for example many mathematical systems, so the claim mistakes contradicting known physics for logical contradiction.

            1.4.7.6.3.2.2. Pro:
            The definition of omnipotence doesn't have to include the ability to do things that are logically incoherent in and of themselves.

          1.4.7.6.3.3. Con:
          This argument [963] can be resolved by noting that God has not created this stone he supposedly could not lift.

            1.4.7.6.3.3.1. Con:
            That God has not created such a stone is also consistent with God not existing, which would be perfectly consistent with the "stone so heavy..." argument against the possibility of an omnipotent being, so this objection does nothing.

              1.4.7.6.3.3.1.1. Con:
              But in this particular branch of the discussion, the atheist is arguing for the non-existence of God from the paradox of omnipotence. This is an attempted resolution of that paradox not, in this branch, an argument for the existence of God.

          1.4.7.6.3.4. Con:
          This argument could be resolved by noting that a rock could be in a position where it can not be lifted, like in orbit.

            1.4.7.6.3.4.1. Con:
            Time and space are relative, so despite the fact that it was in orbit, it could be "lifted" from a relative position.

          1.4.7.6.3.5. Con:
          Logic and order in the universe follow from the logic and order of the Creator. While He might be able to create such a rock by His omnipotence, being consistent, it is unlikely He would.

            1.4.7.6.3.5.1. Pro:
            Not only due to being consistent, logically it may also be due to have an ever-increasing potency. If perfection of God is a dynamic concept, then His potency is not fixed at some point, but is always striving towards infinity. Then it would be possible for Him to create with His maximum, and at the next moment He might as well exceed that maximum.

            1.4.7.6.3.5.2. Con:
            To affirm even the theoretical possibility that God "might" be able to do logical inconsistencies makes the concept of God a contradiction.

              1.4.7.6.3.5.2.1. Con:
              It is reasonable to assume an omnipotent God could refashion the laws of nature and logic to suite such a hypothetical. So to suggest that he "might" is not necessarily a contradiction to the notion of God.

                1.4.7.6.3.5.2.1.1. Con:
                Logic cannot be hacked. 2+2 is always 4, some principles must be followed. As far as we know, there is no example when logic goes bananas. Logic may be a limited tool, which cannot grasp the reality in total, but is an accurate one. We must follow this rule in order to have a meaningful debate, unless we are shown how exactly laws of logic can be refashioned in some possible reality and what are the consequences of that intervention, meaning change in any parameter may  be logically compensated.

        1.4.7.6.4. Con:
        The answer to your conundrum is that there is a way for him to do anything; the contradictions exist because we as finite beings cannot grasp the complexities and magnitude of any reality outside of our space-and-time existence.

        1.4.7.6.5. Con:
        Classical theists do not believe that omnipotence was ever meant to include logical impossibilities. There is no thing which God cannot do, and logical contradictions are not truly things but inconsistent bugs in language.

        1.4.7.6.6. Con:
        The Stone Paradox is ineffective against a Leibniz-Ross formulation of omnipotence [964]. Omnipotence defined as "the ability to do anything" is not accepted by all Christian theologians.

          1.4.7.6.6.1. Con:
          So then God isn't fully omnipotent. If we are talking about a god that is perfect, that implies he is perfectly omnipotent and so, can do anything. If Christian God isn't omnipotent, then he isn't perfect; therefore, he isn't God.

      1.4.7.7. Pro:
      Omniscience, omnipotence and omnibenevolence are mutually exclusive.

        1.4.7.7.1. Con:
        It is not contradictory to be all powerful, all knowing, and perfectly good. One is about ability to act, one is about ability to know, and one is about moral evaluation of actions or character.

          1.4.7.7.1.1. Pro:
          Omniscience means to know the truth value of all (non-devious) propositions. Some propositions like, "This proposition is false" make for interesting puzzles in philosophical logic, but do not impact omniscience. If there is some truth to be known, something omniscient knows it. If not, then it doesn't.

            1.4.7.7.1.1.1. Con:
            An omniscient being would not know how it feels to be ignorant. While it is logically possible to experience one's ignorance, God is incapable of ignorance. This is an essential contradiction.

              1.4.7.7.1.1.1.1. Con:
              Omniscience deals with knowledge, while impassability deals with experience. One can certainly have knowledge of things without having experienced them.

                1.4.7.7.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
                The literal definition of experience [965] is knowledge obtained through observation and/or participation or the act of perceiving and thus observing events or reality. If one cannot experience something, one can't know that experience.

                1.4.7.7.1.1.1.1.2. Con:
                I can have the knowledge of women, yet I fail to experience how does it feel to be one. The parent claim specifically says that this first hand experience is what God lacks. Impassability is about having the experience but not being affected, or "touched" by it, but then that "touch" is just one step away experience that God lacks.

                  1.4.7.7.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con:
                  This does not contest the claim that one can have knowledge of things without having experienced them or that said claim is irrelevant to its parent.

                1.4.7.7.1.1.1.1.3. Con:
                The parent claim introduced ignorance as emotion. I mentioned fear as the experience of an emotion. Your argument should move one level up.

                1.4.7.7.1.1.1.1.4. Pro:
                As human beings, some knowledge is only available to us via experience since it's impossible to accurately describe emotions and we cannot predict accurately how something will feel. This is where God differs as he can predict perfectly what would be the emotions attached to an experience without living it.

              1.4.7.7.1.1.1.2. Con:
              According to his own claim, Jesus is God incarnated as human, and thus would have experienced ignorance.

              1.4.7.7.1.1.1.3. Con:
              The concept of omniscience in Hinduism associated with the God as the Supersoul (Paramatma [966]) incorporates the limits of knowledge through the notion of omnipresence.

              1.4.7.7.1.1.1.4. Con:
              The paradox created by an omniscient God being unable to know ignorance does not make omniscience logically impossible, it merely provides further evidence that paradoxes are common in nature.

              1.4.7.7.1.1.1.5. Con:
              This assumes that "you have to be one to know one", that is, that to know what an experience is like you need to have had that experience. While it may be hard for people to gain knowledge of what others' experiences are truly like, it is still possible.

              1.4.7.7.1.1.1.6. Con:
              This confuses knowledge how and knowledge that. Omniscience only means to know all true propositions, but it says nothing about having particular experiences, such as experiencing ignorance.

            1.4.7.7.1.1.2. Con:
            God cannot know if there is something that he does not know. Thus his knowledge must be incomplete contradicting omniscience.

              1.4.7.7.1.1.2.1. Pro:
              For God to know what He does not know that He does not know, He would have to know what He does not know that He does not know, which is self-contradictory. Therefore, whether such thing exists, its existence is fundamentally unknowable no matter how much God knows.

                1.4.7.7.1.1.2.1.1. Con:
                The initial premise is that God knows absolutely everything.

              1.4.7.7.1.1.2.2. Con:
              This argument begs the question. It assumes that there are certain things that God has no knowledge of under the definition of omniscience in order to prove that there are certain things he has no knowledge of under the definition of omniscience.

          1.4.7.7.1.2. Pro:
          It is coherent and consistent to be perfectly good. It means, at least, that all actions performed by the perfectly good thing are morally permissible. All these concepts are clear and coherent, and being so for every action is not any more incoherent than doing good in some single action.

            1.4.7.7.1.2.1. Con:
            There are conceptions of God in classical theology, such as in the flood story, when God is conveyed as imperfect, or as having the ability to make mistakes.

            1.4.7.7.1.2.2. Con:
            To presume perfect good is to presume a complete picture of morality is known, which it is not, and this is not a problem that can be skirted by the bald assertion of perfection.

            1.4.7.7.1.2.3. Con:
            A question to highlight the competing tensions within omnipotence.
            Is god perfectly just or perfectly merciful?
            Being just means individuals get what they deserve.
            Being merciful means leniency is shown.
            Any increase in justice decreases mercy, and the converse.
            It cannot logically be both.

          1.4.7.7.1.3. Pro:
          Having abilities to act does not restrict knowledge or constitute moral flaws, having abilities to know does not restrict abilities to act or constitute moral flaws, and while moral goodness may lead one to not act some way, it does not make one unable to act in any way or know anything. No contradiction

            1.4.7.7.1.3.1. Con:
            This inadvertently minimises the claim by leaving out the omni aspect.
            'Having abilities to act' is an imperfect claim that falls short of omnipotence.
            Omnipotence restricts knowledge and restricts moral perfection.
            Being able to perform anything means one cannot know what they are incapable of performing (reduction in knowledge), it also means they are less morally perfect than a being incapable of evil (reduction in moral perfection).
            The interaction between the three generates contradiction.

          1.4.7.7.1.4. Con:
          Assuming morality of "good" and "evil" behaviors exists, an entity possessing complete knowledge must be be immoral, not just moral-good as knowledge of experience of only good would be incomplete knowledge.

            1.4.7.7.1.4.1. Con:
            This presents a misunderstanding of omniscience. Omniscience is typically defined as "knowing every true fact". This does not require experiential knowledge of immorality.

            1.4.7.7.1.4.2. Con:
            God is not subject to any external standard of morality. As the ultimate metaphysical reality and the creator of all things created, His character and behavior is the very standard of morality by which all actions by moral agents are judged to be good or evil. 
            
            Therefore, God is not technically "good", as that phrasing implies that He conforms to an external standard of goodness. Rather, He is Goodness Personified.

          1.4.7.7.1.5. Con:
          The contradiction comes from the interaction between two or more omni characteristics. If you have perfect ability to act a realm of knowledge is restricted (knowledge about your limitations to act), also your moral character is reduced (you are less morally perfect than something incapable of evil). This contradiction can be expressed from the perspective of any omni claim.
          Add another omni such as omni-present same contradictions. One omni, logically consistent. Two or more, inconsistent.

            1.4.7.7.1.5.1. Con:
            A being that is both omniscient and omnipotent would not be lacking knowledge about their limits, but rather would have a perfect knowledge that they have no limits.

            1.4.7.7.1.5.2. Con:
            A being with omnipotence would not be limited by logic. It would be capable of things that are logically contradictory.

            1.4.7.7.1.5.3. Con:
            Making moral judgements or evaluations about God based on human understanding would be irrelevant since God would be the only instance that would have full knowledge and control over objective moral code. Also it would be quite likely that moral guidelines that apply to humans would not be intended to apply to God.

          1.4.7.7.1.6. Con:
          Any moral reasoning comes from a compilation of traditions. As the word, from latin <<mores>> means "A set of norms or customs derived from generally accepted practices rather than written laws" An omniscient, eternal entity can have no morality, nor set of customs compiled through practice.

            1.4.7.7.1.6.1. Con:
            This definition of morals does not however apply in the case that God exists. According to Christianity, objective morality is defined by God, not people or "generally accepted practices".

        1.4.7.7.2. Con:
        This does not support the claim that God is said to be omnipotent but is also unable to do certain things.

        1.4.7.7.3. Pro:
        The divine attributes of omnipotence and omniscience are mutually exclusive because perfect knowledge of what will happen in the future precludes having the power to change it.

          1.4.7.7.3.1. Con:
          The concept of "changing the future" is incoherent. Influencing it or bringing about what happens make sense. Changing it does not.

            1.4.7.7.3.1.1. Pro:
            A change requires that things be in one state then later be in a different state. To change the future would mean that at some time t1, things at a future time F were in state S, then later at time t2, things at the time F were not in state S. This is incoherent.

          1.4.7.7.3.2. Con:
          God doesnt have to be in time so that linear "changes" effect him, he is immanent and transcendent

          1.4.7.7.3.3. Pro:
          A being that does not have the power to change the future is not all powerful.

          1.4.7.7.3.4. Pro:
          A being that does not know what will happen in the future is not all knowing.

            1.4.7.7.3.4.1. Con:
            There is no known future, since there is nothing to be known.

          1.4.7.7.3.5. Con:
          Future events, in this context, are logically prior to knowledge of them. That is to say, having knowledge of the future does not entail a lack of ability to change the future, but is merely the additional power to know what one will ultimately "decide".

            1.4.7.7.3.5.1. Pro:
            Molinism [967] holds that God knows in advance what one will freely decide, given any set of circumstances he produces, and (therefore) takes these potential into consideration in ordering events. Thus, both free will and the omniscience of God are preserved.

          1.4.7.7.3.6. Con:
          The idea of omniscience and omnipotence are not mutually exclusive, as the knowledge could simultaneously change through action.

            1.4.7.7.3.6.1. Con:
            If a god creates the future, he automatically negates any chance of free will

              1.4.7.7.3.6.1.1. Con:
              According to compatibilism [968], free will is possible even if the world is deterministic.

                1.4.7.7.3.6.1.1.1. Pro:
                -> See 1.3.7.3.4.2.3.1.5.

              1.4.7.7.3.6.1.2. Con:
              Considering God, who is out of time it is not true - such God possibly is not creating future, he has already already created it. He is out of time, therefore in act of creation all of it was made out of bonds of time, but it's possible that God is not choosing what would be, he created some starting point and taken action at only some points.

            1.4.7.7.3.6.2. Con:
            If the actions of a god change its knowledge, it cannot have been omniscient previously.

              1.4.7.7.3.6.2.1. Con:
              God's knowledge is always up to date.

                1.4.7.7.3.6.2.1.1. Con:
                If knowledge needs updating, then it's by definition not all-encompassing.

                  1.4.7.7.3.6.2.1.1.1. Con:
                  Knowledge base is ever increasing. In order to know everything, God need to be instantly ever updated. This means omniscience is interactive.

                    1.4.7.7.3.6.2.1.1.1.1. Con:
                    God is not discovering things at the same rate we are, just like a parent already knows so much more than his newborn child.

              1.4.7.7.3.6.2.2. Con:
              Classical theism does not claim that God's actions changes His knowledge. Rather, He knows the results of all actions before they are done.

            1.4.7.7.3.6.3. Pro:
            The modern term is "interactive". Everything is changing, so actions are always adapting to the changes in environment. In physiology it is called biofeedback.

          1.4.7.7.3.7. Con:
          This is an attempt to fit an infinite concept into a finite set of restrictions. An omni-being by denotation cannot be limited in any way.

          1.4.7.7.3.8. Con:
          Knowing the future does not preclude being able to change it. That would only be the case if 'the future' was all powerful/ God.

        1.4.7.7.4. Pro:
        -> See 1.4.7.1.1.2.4.5.

        1.4.7.7.5. Con:
        Because we have no full concept and no experience of these terms, perhaps they could actually be contingent on each other. 'Knowing all' may require 'all-power', and 'omnibenevolence' could be decided upon by the entity that fits this description.

        1.4.7.7.6. Con:
        God's omnibenevolence can be taken for granted.

          1.4.7.7.6.1. Pro:
          God decides what is good, therefore God's goodness is uncontestable.

            1.4.7.7.6.1.1. Con:
            His creation subjects great suffering onto other aspects of his creation. Sometimes it's their sole means of survival. [969]

              1.4.7.7.6.1.1.1. Con:
              Fiction writers are not considered evil for creating misery for their fictional characters to deliver experiences to the existent readers. Therefore, God would also not be evil for creating misery for his existent creatures to deliver experiences to his own transcendent perception.

                1.4.7.7.6.1.1.1.1. Con:
                God's (if he existed) creations aren't fictional, they/we actually exist.

            1.4.7.7.6.1.2. Con:
            God does not decide what is good. This is one horn of the Euthyphro dilemma [970], and would make good and evil arbitrary.

              1.4.7.7.6.1.2.1. Con:
              Everything is arbitrary to the ultimate God. Primary principles of omniscience, omnipotence and omnipresence ensure that. However, God doesn't change (immutability), and this results in the definition of an absolute point of moral reference.

                1.4.7.7.6.1.2.1.1. Con:
                Morality being arbitrary to God, even in principle, regardless of whether he chooses to make arbitrary changes, render morality arbitrary. If some "objective morality" truly exists, it must be beyond the possibility of such changes.

          1.4.7.7.6.2. Pro:
          God has unlimited knowledge to determine his own goodness eternally, and he has unlimited power to become absolutely good eternally, therefore God is absolutely good.

            1.4.7.7.6.2.1. Pro:
            The human concept of "good" does not apply to God.

              1.4.7.7.6.2.1.1. Pro:
              -> See 1.4.7.7.1.4.2.

              1.4.7.7.6.2.1.2. Pro:
              The human concept of "good" is conditioned by our limited knowledge of, and limited power over our environment, therefore fallacious when applied to the absolute.

              1.4.7.7.6.2.1.3. Con:
              Yet God passed his word/law onto his people, and by following that law/those words he deems them "good" enough to achieve eternal salvation. God, in the hypothetical of him existing, created us and our understanding of "good".

            1.4.7.7.6.2.2. Con:
            A necessary being cannot "become". God, as a necessary being, is fully actualized, has no potentiality, and cannot change.

          1.4.7.7.6.3. Con:
          God's omnibenevolence can be exaggerated.

            1.4.7.7.6.3.1. Con:
            A maximally-great being would be the greatest possible good; therefore, it is impossible to conceive of any greater good. This allows no possibility of exaggeration.

        1.4.7.7.7. Pro:
        An omnipotent being would be able to create something "unknowable", even if just a 'secret'. This contradicts omniscience.

          1.4.7.7.7.1. Con:
          There is no contradiction here. You are just missing the next logical step. If God can create something unknown, he can also expand him self to know it. It's like the question if God is all powerful can he create something so heavy that he himself cannot lift it. Again the answer is yes he can, but then in the next moment he can expand his strength to be able to lift it.

          1.4.7.7.7.2. Con:
          The above claim is a logical fallacy. Similar fallacies would include an omnipotent being creating a situation where he had no power, or an omniscient being knowing what he does not know.

          1.4.7.7.7.3. Con:
          An omnipotent being would be able to rewrite the way logic works in the universe to eliminate any contradiction with omniscience. But that's not necessary unless God has a reason to create something unknowable.

        1.4.7.7.8. Con:
        There is no direct logical contradiction here. A square circle is an incoherent statement because the words contradict one another. The words, all good, all powerful and all knowing do not contradict one another.

          1.4.7.7.8.1. Con:
          Theodicy [971] makes [972] omniscience, omnipotence and omnibenevolence mutually exclusive

            1.4.7.7.8.1.1. Con:
            Theodicy is actually a different subject. The claim made above was that the three qualities contradict one another. Theodicy or the problem of evil of addresses the claim that the 3 qualities are incompatible with the world we observe. Mutually exclusive and not commensurate with the world we live in are 2 very different claims, therefore it remains that the 3 qualities are not mutually exclusive.

            1.4.7.7.8.1.2. Con:
            Any combination of two of the "omni" words are logically consistent, even according to Theodocy [973] therefore none of them are "mutually exclusive." However, adding the third "omni" to the mix does create a logical paradox.

          1.4.7.7.8.2. Con:
          Any two of these "omni" words will contradict the remaining one.

        1.4.7.7.9. Pro:
        Theodicy [974] problem can only be solved [975] by ignoring one of the three "omni"

          1.4.7.7.9.1. Con:
          This is only even plausibly true if one adds the data that there is real evil in the world. That cannot be demonstrated on the assumption of atheism. Hence, this line of argument undercuts itself.

            1.4.7.7.9.1.1. Con:
            Even if God's existence were necessary and sufficient for "real evil" to be identifiable, one can simply alter the argument to replace "evil" with "that which would be evil, if anything".

          1.4.7.7.9.2. Con:
          This is not true. The assumption of this claim this that the way the world operates now is faulty as it permits evil. It's logically possible that by not allowing evil a greater evil would be done.

          1.4.7.7.9.3. Con:
          The problem of evil can also be compared to children whose loving parents are strict and sometimes enforce discipline. Such children often feel wronged by their parents. When they mature and grow up they can see that their parents were in fact doing what was best for them but they were unable to see it at the time.

            1.4.7.7.9.3.1. Con:
            When a child who is beaten grows up to beat their own children, that's not "growing up and seeing that their parents were doing what was best for them", that's a cycle of violence [976].

          1.4.7.7.9.4. Con:
          Reincarnation solves the problem of evil as people could be suffering reactions to actitivities they perfmormed in previous life times. To solve the problem of evil this reactions would need to be for the purpose of correcting the mentality and conciousness of the person.

            1.4.7.7.9.4.1. Pro:
            For example most bad mentalities some how or other cause others to suffer. Suffering is a good teacher of compassion as we can understand from the common line "I don't want anyone else to suffer the way I did". Therfore suffering can be a kind of cosmic sensitivity training.

      1.4.7.8. Pro:
      God cannot be all powerful because he can't prove his own non-existence.

        1.4.7.8.1. Pro:
        An all knowing, all seeing God would speak (or act) to make his presence known, and most major religions report that God makes his will clearly known by communicating to humans. Yet, no such communication exists today.

          1.4.7.8.1.1. Con:
          Many contemporary people claim to have received communications from God. To assume that they are all wrong in order to conclude that God does not communicate with people today is circular reasoning.

          1.4.7.8.1.2. Con:
          The presumption that an all knowing and all seeing God would speak or act to make its presence known is logically unfounded. An artist, for example, does not maintain eternal vigil alongside the works they have created.

            1.4.7.8.1.2.1. Con:
            If we presume that certain sacred documents are divinely inspired, dictated, or authored, then it seems to follow that God has at least some interest in communicating with humanity, thereby making its presence known.

              1.4.7.8.1.2.1.1. Con:
              God may have had interest in communicating with humanity historically, but may believe that past communication was sufficient enough and is not necessarily tied to an eternity of such communication.

              1.4.7.8.1.2.1.2. Con:
              The interest in communicating with humanity may not stem from a desire to make its presence known - correlation is not causation. The existence of such documents merely indicates a supernatural presence. For an idea of its interests, one has to gather more information, say from the documents themselves.

          1.4.7.8.1.3. Con:
          Mormons believe that God continues to communicate with humans today through living prophets today as he did in ancient times as recorded in the Bible and the Book of Mormon. (see Prophets) [977]

            1.4.7.8.1.3.1. Con:
            Mormon prophets do not demonstrate that they have any more access to divine guidance than other humans.

          1.4.7.8.1.4. Con:
          The Bible is said to be God's communication to men. In the Bible it states why man is left alone without communication for the time.

            1.4.7.8.1.4.1. Con:
            Historical records (including some present within the Bible) suggest it was written and compiled for political purposes. Particularly gaining support for: the attempted annexation of Judah to Israel (~8th century BCE), the Maccabean Revolt (167 BCE - 160 BCE) and the First Jewish-Roman War (66 CE - 70 CE).

            1.4.7.8.1.4.2. Con:
            Nothing within the Bible suggest it was truly inspired by a higher power.

              1.4.7.8.1.4.2.1. Con:
              Being unable to see that something is inspired by a higher power is not evidence that it wasn't inspired by a higher power.

          1.4.7.8.1.5. Con:
          There is no current intellectual consensus on what would constitute proof positive of such communication, which might be a reason why there appears to be no communication at all - if the folder doesn't exist, there can't possibly be any documents in it.

          1.4.7.8.1.6. Con:
          At a personal level, many believe the Vedas to be divinely inspired, if not dictated. Similarly for the Bible and the Quran.

            1.4.7.8.1.6.1. Pro:
            In traditional Hinduism, even the Mahabharata is considered a true tale of direct divine intervention in human affairs. As for whether it truly is an example of divine communication - the story has been studied and commented on by several generations of Indian writers, and has been found to contain deep lessons in philosophy, statecraft, human morality and psychology. In many ways, it is a textbook for human psychological development. (It's also a damn good story, but I may be biased.)

        1.4.7.8.2. Con:
        All powerful God might be able to prove false statements. This is contradictory. By principle of explosion [978], this would allow him to prove any statements.

          1.4.7.8.2.1. Con:
          This does not contest that God cannot prove his own non-existence (the premise), nor does it contest the validity of the parent argument. Therefore, it doesn't oppose the parent claim.

        1.4.7.8.3. Con:
        "His Omnipotence means power to do all that is [possible], not to do the [impossible].... meaningless combinations of words do not suddenly acquire meaning simply because we prefix to them the two other words 'God can.'... It is no more possible for God than for the weakest of his creatures to carry out both of two mutually exclusive alternatives; not because his power meets an obstacle, but because nonsense remains nonsense even when we talk it about God." -- C.S. Lewis, The Problem of Pain

        1.4.7.8.4. Pro:
        If God was all-powerful and therefore could prove his own nonexistence, and his proof would be correct and realistic, he would not exist. This is a contradiction.

          1.4.7.8.4.1. Con:
          The argument begs the question by assuming the conclusion. "If God... could prove his own nonexistence, and his proof [is] correct... he would not exist."
          
          Of course if he correctly proves that he does not exist, he would not exist!

            1.4.7.8.4.1.1. Con:
            No the claim does not assume its conclusion. Just because certain proofs exist doesn't mean the reality agrees with the proof. Nor does it mean the proof is correct. But due to that, each step of the proof must be explicitly stated and justified.

              1.4.7.8.4.1.1.1. Con:
              That the proof is correct is a given in the grandparent claim.

                1.4.7.8.4.1.1.1.1. Con:
                Actually that part had to be explicitly assumed, otherwise the claim would not be sufficiently justified. But this is not in any way circular.

          1.4.7.8.4.2. Con:
          It has not been shown that an all-powerful being can do illogical tasks, such as proving their own non-existence.

            1.4.7.8.4.2.1. Con:
            By definition of all-powerful, a being is not all-powerful, if there exists tasks which the being is unable to perform.

              1.4.7.8.4.2.1.1. Con:
              Because logically incoherent tasks are logically incoherent, they do not exist.

              1.4.7.8.4.2.1.2. Con:
              There is no singular prescriptive definition of "all-powerful" from which to argue "by definition".

                1.4.7.8.4.2.1.2.1. Con:
                There is no requirement for 'singular' for the definition of all-powerful. Many different definitions of all-powerful all satisfy the principle that to be all-powerful, an entity must be able to perform any actions.

          1.4.7.8.4.3. Con:
          It has not been shown that an omnibenevolent being could lie by proving their non-existence when they actually exist.

            1.4.7.8.4.3.1. Con:
            The claim is about whether all-powerful entities can do certain contradictory actions. The claim is not about omnibenevolence, which is unrelated.

              1.4.7.8.4.3.1.1. Con:
              The claim is about the God of classical theism, who is omni-benevolent and cannot lie. If the grandparent claim imagines that God can lie, then it fails because it addresses a straw man god, not the God of classical theism.

              1.4.7.8.4.3.1.2. Pro:
              Only omnipotence of God is needed to prove the contradiction. Omnibenevolence cannot avoid this problem because every notion of God that assumes God is omnipotent would be subject to same proof by contradiction.

          1.4.7.8.4.4. Pro:
          Clearly the abilities of an all-powerful being would be limited, if he cannot do such illogical action. The definition of "all-powerful [979]" would reject such limitation by definition, at least in their most strong form. Therefore all-powerful entities that can perform all, even absurd, kinds of illogical actions cannot exist. Hence, a God that is in such sense all-powerful does not exist.

          1.4.7.8.4.5. Con:
          Even if an all-powerful being can do illogical tasks, it does not follow that He would do illogical tasks.

            1.4.7.8.4.5.1. Con:
            The God of classical theism is not simply an all-powerful being, but He is also the source of morality and cannot lie.

          1.4.7.8.4.6. Pro:
          It is not necessary for the proof that God actually performs any illogical actions. If God is able to perform illogical actions, then these must be consistent. Even if God never actually does such actions. By Compactness theorem [980], If they are consistent with the universe then assuming their occurrence cannot cause contradiction.

          1.4.7.8.4.7. Con:
          Given that God's omnipotence permits him to do logically incoherent things like "correctly prove his own non-existence", existing despite having correctly proven his own non-existence is also within his power.

            1.4.7.8.4.7.1. Con:
            Existing despite having correctly proven his own non-existence would be contradictory according to "principle of explosion [981]" and "Modus ponens [982]".

              1.4.7.8.4.7.1.1. Con:
              God could decide to invalidate the principle of explosion and modus ponens if he chose to (although he would never do this because he wants a reasonable universe).

        1.4.7.8.5. Con:
        An all-good God would not lie, and therefore would never attempt to prove his own nonexistence.

          1.4.7.8.5.1. Con:
          This provides a reason for why God wouldn't prove his own non-existence, but not a counter to the claim that this indicates that God cannot be omnipotent.

      1.4.7.9. Con:
      A better understanding of God's omnipotent nature is that: God can do anything that can be done, and that anything that can be done cannot be limited to my understanding of it.

        1.4.7.9.1. Con:
        But if so, God isn't omnipotent, because he is limited to our comprehension. An omnipotent being can do anything; if he can't do, he isn't omnipotent. If he is limited to what can be done, he cant do what can't be done, so, he cant do a thing and therefore, isn't omnipotent.

      1.4.7.10. Con:
      This is not a contradiction in the definition of God, rather in (some of) the theological systems devised to support certain religions. God is not the same as religion.

    1.4.8. Pro:
    A self-sufficient being would not need praise, yet religious require followers to praise God.

      1.4.8.1. Con:
      God could request praise for the sake of God's devotees, rather than God's own sake.

      1.4.8.2. Con:
      This only produces a contradiction between religious doctrines and the definition of the God of classical theism; there could be a deist God who does not demand worship, and thus no contradiction.

      1.4.8.3. Con:
      No Christian believes He needs it. But we do believe He wants it and we do it out of gratitude, not because He needs it.

      1.4.8.4. Pro:
      A perfect entity needs nothing as it is, by definition, totally developed and unchangeable.

        1.4.8.4.1. Con:
        An unchanging permanence is the definition of a statically perfect (complete) entity. God can be viewed as a dynamically perfect 'entity' - such as the water cycle on Earth. Since the water cycle arises out of basic principles - the transition of a specific compound (water) between solid-liquid-gas states in response to changing energy levels (temperature) - it has existed for billions of years, but still incorporates constant change.

      1.4.8.5. Con:
      'Praise' could also be read as 'worship' - an injunction to practice the preaching.

      1.4.8.6. Con:
      Classical theists would not say that God "needs" praise, but is utterly self-sufficient.

    1.4.9. Pro:
    God is said to be omnipresent but also as having been there when there was nothing yet. This implies that God was simultaneously existent and non-existent.

      1.4.9.1. Pro:
      The apparent definition of God negates God as an existent being. If God is the creator of all things, then God cannot be in the same category of the things created.

        1.4.9.1.1. Con:
        God isn't in the same category of created things (contingent). By definition, God is eternal and necesary.

          1.4.9.1.1.1. Con:
          The logical string that God could not have failed to exist only works if you believe he created the universe. God must exist only if you believe in God. If you don’t believe in God it is wholly possible that he cannot exist.

            1.4.9.1.1.1.1. Con:
            If there is no necessary being to give origin to contingent beings, then there is no way contingent beings could have come to existence. Since contingent beings exist, there must be a necessary being to bring them to existance.

            1.4.9.1.1.1.2. Con:
            Not so. God could exist even if He did not create anything.

        1.4.9.1.2. Con:
        In classical theism, God is not the creator of all things simpliciter, but of all contingent things.

        1.4.9.1.3. Con:
        Not everything that exists is created or crafted.

        1.4.9.1.4. Con:
        God is in his own category. Everything that exists does so in a hierarchy between similarity and dissimilarity with God. A rock is like God only in the fact that it exists. A human is much more like god in the fact that they reason. But God himself is inherent to reality and the only entity that is such.

        1.4.9.1.5. Con:
        If God is assumed to be the universe itself (an oft repeated claim in religious and spiritual documents), then at the instant of the big bang, there was nothing but God - the physical and metaphysical laws that govern everything we know - and an enormous amount of energy. From that initial point, we have evolved to the universe of today, in which everything that we know to exist is a result of what appeared in that first instant. Thus God is both creator of all things and within everything.

        1.4.9.1.6. Con:
        Classical theists do not believe that God is in the same category as things created, and even His existence is qualitatively different from all other kinds of existence. Thomas Aquinas, a famous classical theist, conceived of God not as "a being" but as "Being Itself."

        1.4.9.1.7. Con:
        The claim of God being the creator of all things implies a degree of common sense in its understanding. Namely, God created all things other than himself. The Bible asserts that God is eternal: "from everlasting to everlasting"; without creation; and therefore not in the same category as created things.  (See Psalms 90 verse 2)

          1.4.9.1.7.1. Pro:
          Something created the physical universe that we live in now. There has to be something at the start, and the chances that atoms would become something as complex and meaningful as our world and society are unrealistic without a great and original designer, which would be God. If God does not exist, we would not exist; the amount of fine tuning it takes for humans to exist is reason enough alone to believe in God.

          1.4.9.1.7.2. Con:
          This negates the creation of reality, itself. Either God is the creator of reality, and he was outside of reality during its creation (i.e., is not real), or was within reality, and thus not the creator of all things.

            1.4.9.1.7.2.1. Con:
            Reality isn't a "thing" per se, but only a metaphysical concept - the property of being real. As has been stated, God could not create reality while also being real, so there's no contradiction in saying that God did not create reality.

              1.4.9.1.7.2.1.1. Pro:
              Classical theism doesn't claim that God created every concept and entity, only that He is the necessary cause for all contingent things. This is consistent with metaphysical concepts such as reality not being created by God.

              1.4.9.1.7.2.1.2. Con:
              Concepts are things. If God didn't create them, then he didn't create everything.

                1.4.9.1.7.2.1.2.1. Con:
                -> See 1.4.9.1.7.2.1.1.

            1.4.9.1.7.2.2. Con:
            -> See 1.4.9.1.7.2.1.1.

            1.4.9.1.7.2.3. Con:
            God exists in at least 6 or 7 dimensions this claim only makes sense when bound to 3.

        1.4.9.1.8. Pro:
        The definition of God is self-contradictory in that He is beyond space but also omnipresent.

          1.4.9.1.8.1. Con:
          God may affect space, even if space may not affect God.

          1.4.9.1.8.2. Con:
          Omnipresent does not mean existing "within" space.

            1.4.9.1.8.2.1. Pro:
            Modern understanding of space is within a space-time continuum. They cannot be addressed separately. 'God is beyond space' is strictly what Abrahamic religions claim. Illustration for an alternative opinion can be found in another monotheistic religion, Vaishnavism, where God says that He Himself is time Gita 11:32 [983] . In modern language, God is space/time.

          1.4.9.1.8.3. Con:
          "Beyond space yet omnipresent." These are different expressions conveying the same idea. God is to his creation as an author is to his novel. Nowhere, yet everywhere.

        1.4.9.1.9. Pro:
        The definition of God is self-contradictory in that He is beyond time but also eternal.

          1.4.9.1.9.1. Con:
          God created time. It's like saying a relational human is self-contradictory just because they created unfeeling robots.

          1.4.9.1.9.2. Con:
          Being beyond, or outside of time implies being eternal.

      1.4.9.2. Pro:
      The dilema of an absolute being that contains everything is a variation on the paradox of the irresistible force. It is a false dilema. In this case it is a false dilema that points out that the "existence" cannot possibly be an atribute of an all-containing being.

        1.4.9.2.1. Con:
        Other than a few panentheistic religions, few would support the idea of God being "containing" in any fashion.

      1.4.9.3. Con:
      Our incapable minds are insufficient to comprehend the wonders of God, and just because we don’t understand something does not mean that it is false.

        1.4.9.3.1. Con:
        If we do not understand something, we should approach everything we think we know about that something with a certain amount of doubt. This does not seem to be the prevalent approach to God, however.

        1.4.9.3.2. Con:
        While it is certainly true that our incapability to understand something does not make it false, there exist simpler explanations and theories for God's (non)existence than assuming some mystical ways in which to exist and not exist makes sense, which we can then just label wonders of God and be done with it.

        1.4.9.3.3. Pro:
        There are many things in this Universe that we do not understand yet and there is possibility that God is one (or all) of these things.

        1.4.9.3.4. Con:
        Our incapable minds are insufficient to comprehend many things, but for everything else, there is evidence that we can look for or look at, experiments that we can try to gain more knowledge and so on.

          1.4.9.3.4.1. Pro:
          The only testifiable and shareable piece of evidence for God's existence are words and books made of these words.

            1.4.9.3.4.1.1. Pro:
            A lot of claims in, for example, Bible have been proven as false, such as the existence of global flood at some point in our history, the age of the Earth and the Universe and so on.

              1.4.9.3.4.1.1.1. Con:
              The Bible makes no claims regarding the age of the Earth, nor the universe. Some interpretations argue for an old earth; some for a new earth, but the bible itself does not directly address the issue.

                1.4.9.3.4.1.1.1.1. Con:
                The issue is directly addressed in the Bible. 
                The gospel of Luke contains a genealogy of Jesus [984]. Comparing with the genealogy from Genesis [985], one finds that the Earth and the universe should be approximately 6000 years old.

      1.4.9.4. Pro:
      One of the cornerstones of the classical God is that it is everywhere, though it 's nowhere. It exists yet you cannot point your finger at it. Existence is too human a term to define such a being, regardless it actually may or maynot be.

        1.4.9.4.1. Con:
        Omnipresence excludes being "nowhere". Nothing in the classical definition of God says that God is nowhere.

          1.4.9.4.1.1. Con:
          The fact that God is a creator implies that it was there before there was anything.

        1.4.9.4.2. Con:
        Being present does not necessarily imply being visible. Oxygen is present in the air, yet you cannot see it.

      1.4.9.5. Pro:
      For God to be both the ultimate and encompass everything, they would have to include both 'existing' and 'not-existing' simultaneously.

        1.4.9.5.1. Con:
        It is incoherent to say that something exists and does not exist simultaneously. Nothing in the classical concept of God indicates that even deity is capable of a logical impossibility.

      1.4.9.6. Pro:
      God's higher property beyond existence is probably unfathomable to the human mind. Existence is therefore an unadequate term to use when talking about God.

      1.4.9.7. Con:
      When "there was nothing yet", there was no place in the universe for God to be. Omnipresence is the quality of being at all places at all times. It is not inconsistent with omnipresence to say that God is not in a location that does not exist.

      1.4.9.8. Con:
      -> See 1.4.9.5.1.

      1.4.9.9. Con:
      God both 'existing' and 'not existing' simultaneously is not a mere contradiction that implies his non-existence. It looks more like a quantum superposition. Schrödinger's cat. [986]

        1.4.9.9.1. Con:
        The scale [987] and the interactions with the environment [988] attributed to God make him unlikely to be in a quantum coherent [989] state, therefore can't be described by a superposition of states.

      1.4.9.10. Con:
      This is based on the assumption that God is part of the universe, rather than separate from it. That is a logical fallacy in and of itself, since it would result in causa sui.

    1.4.10. Pro:
    The vast majority of the religious could not comprehend a God that isn't worthy of their faith, yet that is what the classical definition [990] omits: any reference to faith.

      1.4.10.1. Pro:
      The concept of God is generally predicated on belief that following arbitrary tenets can ingratiate you to the being and it would then create and/or improve your afterlife. Without that supernatural promise you have a self-help group instead of a religion and the banal instead of the divine.

      1.4.10.2. Con:
      The classical definition of God defines God as the "absolutely metaphysically ultimate being," and metaphysics [991] deals with the "origins and principles of such things as being, knowing, substance, cause, identity, time, and space"; since these concepts are nonmaterial and "spiritual" is defined as "nonmaterial or opposed to physical or material things," the classical definition of God defines God in a spiritual manner.

    1.4.11. Pro:
    God is defined as having the qualities of both immanence [992] and transcendence [993], which are mutually exclusive concepts.

      1.4.11.1. Con:
      Analogically, a king can influence or visit a prison without becoming bound by the prison. Similarly, God can be a part of the material world while remaining independent of it.

        1.4.11.1.1. Con:
        A jail is indifferent as to who it detains. Absent all but their status, a king is no more able to leave a jail than a subject. In the same way, a god cannot be both manifest in a material universe and also completely independent of it.

      1.4.11.2. Con:
      Ralph Waldo Emerson, father of Transcendentalism [994], often wrote on the transcendent nature of both God and humans.

      1.4.11.3. Con:
      If the fourth dimension is space-time, then a god-like being would only need to exist in a dimension we can not comprehend, like the fifth dimension, to be considered a god to beings in the third dimension.

      1.4.11.4. Pro:
      Transcendence implies that God is beyond humanity's grasp [995], while immanence implies that God is knowable.

      1.4.11.5. Pro:
      If God responds to prayer, then this undermines his transcendence (total independence from all else).

        1.4.11.5.1. Con:
        Prayer does not undermine God's transcendence but illustrates his attributes of mercy, consciousness and free will.

        1.4.11.5.2. Pro:
        Deuteronomy 32:36 [996] says, "Indeed, the LORD will give justice to his people, and he will change his mind about his servants, when he sees their strength is gone and no one is left, slave or free."

      1.4.11.6. Con:
      Transcendence means to “go beyond” or surpass. Therefore, God can transcend creation, yet remain connected to it.

        1.4.11.6.1. Pro:
        In philosophy, transcendence conveys the basic ground concept from the word's literal meaning [997] (from Latin), of climbing or going beyond. Thus, transcendence is not a trait which excludes a being from being in other modes; it actually requires multiple modes of being.

          1.4.11.6.1.1. Con:
          Transcendence in this sense-- being simultaneously capable of subjecting oneself to physical laws (to allow immanence) and also capable of being free of the same--is an explicit contradiction within a single definition. This makes it an unworkable definition by which to define a thing (i.e. God).

            1.4.11.6.1.1.1. Pro:
            The Transcendence of God implies an additional set of laws beyond the Natural Laws which are capable of defining this capacity. This contradicts the definition of Natural Law [998], which is itself universal, precluding a set of laws which is a super set of itself or disjoint from it. God's Transcendence is contradictory by definition, requiring a set of laws greater than the universal set to define it.

        1.4.11.6.2. Pro:
        God manifested in the physical creation of everything at the beginning of the universe and has since maintained a transcendent relationship with creation.

        1.4.11.6.3. Pro:
        According to molinism [999], God considers the free will decisions (including prayers) which will occur in all possible future situations when ordering the world. Thus, God can both "respond" to prayer while remaining immutable.

        1.4.11.6.4. Con:
        "In religion, transcendence refers to the aspect of a god's nature and power which is wholly independent of the material universe, beyond all physical laws." (en.wikipedia.org [1000]) This implies being wholly independent of humans.

          1.4.11.6.4.1. Con:
          If immaterial souls exist that are not subject to physical laws, God could interact with these immaterial souls without violating his transcendence according to this definition.

          1.4.11.6.4.2. Con:
          "Independent of" is not synonymous with "hermetically sealed from". The theist's claim is that God's nature and power exist independently of the material universe. That is, God does not depend on the universe for existence—this is to say neither that God does not effect the universe, nor that his will does not take outside particulars into account.

      1.4.11.7. Con:
      The quality "transcendent" precludes the possibility of an existent referent to provide meaning to the word "God."

    1.4.12. Pro:
    God is said to be all-knowing (omniscient), but there are things that God cannot know.

      1.4.12.1. Pro:
      The definition of God is self-contradictory in that he is omniscient but also impassable [1001]. Either God has experiential knowledge of suffering (which violates impassibility) or does not (which violates omniscience.)

        1.4.12.1.1. Con:
        -> See 1.4.7.7.1.1.1.1.

        1.4.12.1.2. Con:
        -> See 1.4.7.7.1.1.

        1.4.12.1.3. Con:
        Not all classical theists would agree that God is impassable.

      1.4.12.2. Con:
      -> See 1.4.7.7.1.1.

      -> See 1.4.7.7.3.

      1.4.12.4. Pro:
      Humans (and perhaps animals) have free will. For this to be true, God could not know what their actions were going to be in advance, otherwise it wouldn't truly be free.

        1.4.12.4.1. Con:
        Norman Swartz contends that arguments using free will to deny omniscience commit the modal fallacy [1002].

        1.4.12.4.2. Pro:
        We seem to have free will because we are conscious.

          1.4.12.4.2.1. Con:
          Our consciousness seems not to require free will as it happens in deterministic settings (ie. cells).

          1.4.12.4.2.2. Con:
          Consciousness does not seem to require free will, as sugested by the ever more complex digital intelligence and understanding which don't rely on free will at all.

            1.4.12.4.2.2.1. Con:
            A simulation of consciousness does not imply consciousness. The "complex" digital intelligences we have today are vastly inferior [1003] to a human mind.

        1.4.12.4.3. Pro:
        Free-will means that humans are free to make choices, which necessarily implies that their choices cannot be known a-priori. If an all-knowing God knows every choice we make before we make it, then it cannot be said that we have free-will.

          1.4.12.4.3.1. Con:
          According to compatibilism [1004] free choices can be made even if God knows them beforehand.

            1.4.12.4.3.1.1. Pro:
            -> See 1.3.7.3.4.2.3.1.3.1.

            1.4.12.4.3.1.2. Pro:
            -> See 1.3.7.3.4.2.3.1.5.

          1.4.12.4.3.2. Con:
          A-priori here means in advance and refers to something that does not exist. In other words, a non-being. God knows all the being, meaning all there is to be known.

        1.4.12.4.4. Con:
        There is no objective evidence for the existence of free will in the universe, thus free will does not exist.

        1.4.12.4.5. Con:
        Even if God's foreknowledge must result in a fully determined universe, this would not make free will impossible.

          1.4.12.4.5.1. Pro:
          -> See 1.3.7.3.4.2.3.1.

        1.4.12.4.6. Con:
        If God is outside time, as is often understood, then God sees all of history at the same time. We mortals are yet to discover what we will freely decide - but it is all visible to God.

          1.4.12.4.6.1. Con:
          The existence of a being that that can see the future as a fixed certainty (even if only from that being's perspective) contradicts the existence of free will because it would mean we could not do otherwise than what that being knows we will do.

            1.4.12.4.6.1.1. Con:
            Because God is outside of time His "seeing the future" is much the same as his "seeing the present". If the latter wouldn't mean that we aren't free in what we're doing now, then the former doesn't mean that we won't be free then.

              1.4.12.4.6.1.1.1. Con:
              That the perspective of a being outside of time would work that way itself opposes the idea of free will by indicating that the future is fixed.

            1.4.12.4.6.1.2. Con:
            It does not contradict free will, as it doesn't entail that we *could not* do otherwise, only that we *will not* do otherwise.

              1.4.12.4.6.1.2.1. Pro:
              The argument from divine foreknowledge has the form (1) God knows that person P will perform action A. (2) Necessarily, If God knows that person P will perform action A, then person P will perform action A. (3) Therefore, necessarily, person P will perform action A. The "necessarily" in the conclusion here is what apparently makes it the case that we *could not* do otherwise. But the argument is fallacious. Remove the "necessarily" from (3) and it's valid, but then doesn't contradict free will.

        1.4.12.4.7. Con:
        Free will doesn't necessarily exist [1005]. As such, there doesn't seem to be anything escaping omniscience.

      1.4.12.5. Con:
      God (as recognized by the three largest monotheistic religions) is a being of incomprehensible nature. To posit that a human can even fathom what it means that God "knows" is to admit to a fundamentally flawed understanding of omniscience

        1.4.12.5.1. Con:
        -> See 1.3.8.2.4.2.3.

        1.4.12.5.2. Con:
        Saying that X (in this case god) has a property that is incomprehensible is a non-statement. We can't know that something has a property without first defining what that property is. If the property is "all-knowing" or "omniscient" we first have to explain what that means before we can claim that it has that property.

        1.4.12.5.3. Con:
        That omniscience is something we cannot fathom is not a relevant or valid definition.

      1.4.12.6. Pro:
      Many theists hold that God is both all-powerful and all-knowing, yet this entails a contradiction because God would have knowledge of what happens in the future and would be incapable of acting otherwise, and thus lacking free will.

        1.4.12.6.1. Pro:
        An all-powerful being has no limits to what it can do (besides logical impossibilities), and thus must have the ability to make choices and have free will.

          1.4.12.6.1.1. Pro:
          If the universe is deterministic, then free will cannot exist.

        1.4.12.6.2. Con:
        It's possible that God has both made His decisions in advance, and is spontaneously capable of changing His mind and doing something else.

          1.4.12.6.2.1. Con:
          An all-knowing god would already know all the things that he will change his mind about therefore still acting deterministic. He can't both know the future and be able change his mind in a way that he didn't already anticipate beforehand. Therefore god is either all-knowing or can change his mind (mutually exclusive).

        1.4.12.6.3. Con:
        -> See 1.4.9.1.7.2.3.

        1.4.12.6.4. Con:
        Omnipotence only implies determinism for a certain account of freedom, namely that for a being to be free it must be able, all other things being equal, to do otherwise. If the free action of the creature is posited as one of the effects of God's deeds, then the creature is not free in this sense. However this definition of freedom is rejected by many classical theists (cf Thomas Aquinas for whom freedom arises from intellectual universality) and therefore the argument does not follow.

        1.4.12.6.5. Con:
        Even if the universe is deterministic, God, as creator of the universe, is immune from such determinism.

          1.4.12.6.5.1. Pro:
          The creator must be capable of existing without the creation.

            1.4.12.6.5.1.1. Pro:
            If an eternal God requires the existence of His creation, then He could not have existed without it to have created it. This would make the universe either God, or a part of God. This is the god of pantheism or panentheism, not the God of classical theism.

          1.4.12.6.5.2. Pro:
          If the universe is deterministic, then it is the creator who made it so. Because God is immutable, it follows that once God decided (determined) what would happen in the universe, He would not change his mind. In short, it is possible that God freely chose to create a deterministic universe.

        1.4.12.6.6. Con:
        There is no contradiction between all-knowing and all-powerful, unless you mistakenly assume that God is an entity inside of the universe. Classically, he has been conceived of as "outside" of the universe, including time itself. If God is outside of time, then his knowledge of the future does not imply strict determinism.

          1.4.12.6.6.1. Pro:
          God is outside the Universe in the same way a computer programmer is "outside" his program. He can control and affect the program and can see the beginning and end parameters. If the computer program is "artificially intelligent," it can be said to have a measure of "free will," even if the parameters are limited and/or predetermined.

        1.4.12.6.7. Con:
        If the universe unfolds at each step according to the will of God; then the future is knowable by God as it is determined according to God's free will.

      1.4.12.7. Pro:
      -> See 1.4.7.7.1.1.2.

    1.4.13. Con:
    God constrains himself with his own attributes. That is, his love cannot invalidate his justice, his justice invalidate his grace, and his grace invalidate his requirement of righteousness.

      1.4.13.1. Con:
      Justice and Grace and (arguably) love are specifically Christian claims on the nature of God that are not necessarily entailed by the classical theist conception of Pure Act that is omniscient, omnipotent, and benevolent.

      1.4.13.2. Con:
      Self-constraint ("constrains himself") is not counter to the claim it responds to. It is an example of God being omnipotent, not an example of omnipotence being contradictory or incoherent.
